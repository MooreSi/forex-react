# 210 -- What was built on 2026-09-11, and what is still waiting on you

Everything in [200](200-what-a-professional-desk-would-add.md) was built in
one session, plus the defects it named. This is the inventory, the switches,
and the honest list of what is not done.

**Nothing in here changes what the app trades.** Every new decision is
behind a setting that defaults to off, and every default is byte-identical
to the behaviour it replaces. The full suite, all four gates, the coverage
ratchet and the boot smoke were green when it was written.

---

## The defects

| # | defect | what shipped | on? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | fixed TP offsets against a level-score stop: TP1 is 0.43R on a strong level and 0.75R on a weak one | `signal_generator.atr_barriers` -- stop at `ATR x stop_mult`, ladder rescaled so TP1 lands at `ATR x tp1_mult`, relative spacing preserved | `re_atr_barriers_enabled`, **off** |
| 1.2 | items 020 and 030 blocked waiting for excursion to accumulate forward | `excursion_backfill` reconstructs it from broker tick history, for every closed executed signal | on demand, writes two columns |
| 1.3 | the ML gate regresses R over a population whose mean R is negative, so it converges on "trade nothing" | `meta_label.MetaLabeller` -- binary "did this clear its cost", purged and embargoed folds, uniqueness weighting, refuses to arm below 0.55 AUC out of sample | `meta_label_gate_enabled`, **off** |

## The capability gaps

| § | gap | module | reachable from |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | no previous-day/week levels, no VWAP, no volume profile, no initial balance | `market/liquidity_map`, `market/vwap`, `market/volume_profile` | `liquidity_map_levels_enabled`, **off** |
| 4.2 | a signal fires on proximity with no confirmation | `market/entry_trigger` | `entry_trigger_enabled`, **off** |
| 4.3 | the bridge threw away `flags`/`last`/`volume`; no order-flow measurement | bridge passthrough + `market/order_flow` | the study's feed probe |
| 4.4 | five macro features are a constant for 96% of training rows | `macro_backfill` | controller, **dry run by default** |
| 4.5 | no per-regime accounting | `attribution`'s extra-axis hook | the study |
| 5.1 | execution cost is a constant, never measured | `broker/tca` + `tca_repo`, table `execution_quality` | the study |
| 5.2 | no purging, no embargo, no multiple-testing correction | `market/validation` | `meta_label` |
| 5.3 | no counterfactual exit evaluation | `market/exit_replay`, `market/barrier_fit` | the study |
| 5.4 | sizing knows nothing about volatility, drawdown or correlated exposure | `risk/sizing_policy` | `vol_target_sizing_enabled`, `correlated_exposure_cap_lots`, **both off and NOT wired to the order path -- see below** |
| 5.6 | binary news blackout; no clock-driven illiquidity | `risk/event_tiers`, `risk/session_liquidity` | `event_tier_gate_enabled`, `session_liquidity_gate_enabled`, **off** |
| 5.7 | a version bump goes live and the evidence arrives afterwards | `reversal_engine/shadow` -- champion and four challengers, recorded per fill attempt | always records; changes nothing |
| 5.8 | the cohort analysis is hand-written SQL on a Monday morning | `reversal_engine/attribution` | the study, Reversal panel |
| 5.9 | single-instrument by construction | `market/correlation` -- cross-asset correlation and a correlation-aware exposure number | the study |

## The EA template

`Reversal ATR v1`, in `broker/ea_template_presets.py`, created by the **Add
Built-in** button on Trading > EA Templates. It is **assigned to no
channel** and trades nothing until somebody selects it.

Two supporting changes made it real rather than notional:

- **`atr_ladder_scale`** (migration 39, off by default). `use_dynamic_atr`
  sized the stop and TP1 only, so a volatile day moved those two and left
  TP2 where it was. This rescales the whole anchor ladder around TP1 and
  keeps its spacing.
- **The backtest can now evaluate it.** `template_simulator` refused
  `use_dynamic_atr` outright; the bar walk now takes the ATR the engine
  already computes at the fill. The tick walk still refuses, because a tick
  series has no candles to derive one from.

## The one thing deliberately left unwired

**`sizing_policy` is built, tested and NOT connected to the order path.**

Position sizing is on the short list of things this repo says to stop and
ask about, and "the user said build it" is not sign-off for the
money-touching half. The module is pure and its composed default returns
the lot size it was given, unchanged. Connecting it is one call at the
sizing site, and it wants a demo session and someone watching.

## How to turn any of it on

**Signal Generator > Reversal Engine > Tuning**, then Save Tuning. (The
card was called "Reversal Engine Capabilities" and lived under Trading >
Strategy when this was written; it moved on 2026-09-11 and was renamed on
2026-09-17, both owner requests.) It sits beside the other behaviour gates because these
are tier-2 trading behaviour, not calibration constants
([60-adding-a-tunable](../../system/rules/60-adding-a-tunable.md)).

The switches shipped on 2026-09-11 with no UI at all, which meant the only
way to reach them was editing `vantage_risk_settings` by hand. That was an
omission, not a design choice; the card and
`tests/frontend/test_capability_switches_have_controls.py` (which fails if a
migration adds a switch the form forgets) landed the same day.

Two switches behave differently from the rest and the card says so:

- **Ask the meta-labeller** does nothing until the Research study has costed
  a few hundred trades. The model refuses to arm until it can beat a coin
  out of sample, and an unarmed model blocks nothing.
- **Scale size by volatility and drawdown** records the intent and changes
  no lot size, because `sizing_policy` is deliberately not wired to the
  order path yet.

## What to do next, in order

Nothing in steps 1 to 3 risks a pound.

1. **Run the study** (Reversal panel > Research > Run study). It probes what
   the broker's tick history actually reaches back to, reconstructs
   excursion for every closed trade, prices every fill, and prints the
   attribution table, the fitted barriers and the exit-policy sweep.
2. **Read the barrier fit.** If it refuses on sample size, that is the
   answer: it needs more backfilled trades, and the probe will say whether
   the broker can supply them.
3. **Read the breakeven line in the sweep.** `tools/exit_policy_lab.py`
   found a penalty in 8 of 8 configurations on the main trading path. If
   the reversal engine's own trades agree, item 030 is settled.
4. **Then a demo session**, one switch at a time, in this order: items 040
   / 050 / 100 (already built, still never demoed), then
   `re_atr_barriers_enabled` with the fitted multiples, then the template
   in shadow, then sizing.

## What was NOT built, and why

- **Multi-symbol trading.** The bridge binds one symbol at module level, and
  so do the EA and the trade schema. Multi-symbol market DATA is wired
  (`get_candles_for_symbol` was already there) and `market/correlation` uses
  it; placing an order on a second instrument is a separate piece of work
  measured in sessions.
- **A real regime model.** Three regime classifications already exist in
  this codebase. A fourth is a duplicate; the accounting was the gap, and
  that shipped.
- **Refitting `score_level`'s type weights.** They rank how well a level
  predicts the reference channel's behaviour rather than whether the trade
  makes money. Changing them changes which signals fire, and the evidence to
  change them correctly is the attribution table that has just started
  collecting. See [simon-handover/029](../../simon-handover/029-the-engine-no-longer-copies-gold-diggers.md).

333 of those tests are new and belong to this change.

**What this does NOT verify.** Every switch listed above is off, so the
suite proves the new code is correct and that turning it OFF changes
nothing. It proves nothing about the behaviour of any of them turned ON.
That is what the demo session is for, and it is why they ship off.

## First live run, 2026-09-11 15:26, demo account 26004592

The app was restarted onto commit `2c7768e` and the study run from the
panel. Migrations 39, 40 and 41 applied to the database actually in use
(`forex_trader_demo_26004592.db`, now at schema version 41) and every new
switch came up off.

`forex_trader_demo.db` (account 25470480) is at version 35 and NOT migrated.
It has not been written to since 2026-09-09 -- it is the previous account's
database and is no longer in use. Worth knowing before anyone queries it and
reads the numbers as current.

### What the study found

**The broker keeps 30 days of ticks, not 90.** `{1: 36797, 7: 27641,
30: 25329, 90: 0, 180: 0}`. Excursion can be reconstructed a month back and
no further, so the backfill is a one-off catch-up plus whatever the live
sampler collects from here.

**469 excursions reconstructed in about 90 seconds**, 31 with no tick
coverage, zero failures. Coverage went from 102 to 571 of 785 closed live
trades. Items 020 and 030 are no longer blocked on data.

**The feed carries no trade side.** "quote-only feed: no trade side, so
delta can only ever be a tick-rule proxy on this instrument". That is the
measurement section 4.3 insisted on before building anything on delta, and
the answer is: do not build measured delta on this broker.

**Measured round-trip cost: 0.372R**, from 289 costed fills -- mean 0.219
points of spread and 0.438 points of slippage against a mean 3.71 point
stop. **Read the slippage figure carefully**: the reference price is the
middle of the signal's own entry zone, so it measures the distance between
where the signal said it wanted in and where it actually got in. That is a
real cost and it is not broker slippage. Separating the two needs the
decision-time tick, which is a small follow-up.

**The fitted barriers are a diagnosis, not a recommendation.** Stop 18.82
points (2.5x ATR), target 4.85 (0.6x ATR), implied R:R 0.258 from 351
winners. Read plainly: on this population the trades that eventually win
frequently go a long way against first and then barely travel in favour.
Nobody should set a 2.5x ATR stop off this; it says the entries are the
problem, not the exit geometry.

**Every exit configuration's 95% interval straddles zero** on the 60-path
sample. The best cell (stop 2 / target 12) is +0.481R [-0.364, +1.333],
holding sign across both chronological halves. The gradient toward a
tighter stop and a wider target is the same one `tools/exit_policy_lab.py`
found independently in July, which is worth something; the intervals say
raise the sample before acting.

**Item 030's suspect is cleared.** The replay prices the breakeven move at
+0.036R, +0.027R and -0.007R across three stop/target pairs -- roughly free,
not the large penalty the naive split implied. The attribution table shows
exactly why the naive reading was wrong: BE-moved trades are 126 rows at a
**100% win rate**, because a trade only reaches breakeven by going into
profit first. The replay controls for that selection. **The breakeven move
is not what is costing the engine money.**

**`score_level`'s weights are contradicted by outcome.** `round_5` is
scored highest at 0.78 and is the worst cohort on the book: 210 trades,
-0.157R, -$1,322. `unicorn` is the best at +0.559R and +$625 on 18 trades.
This is the evidence `simon-handover/029` said would be needed to refit
those weights.

**Item 040 confirmed on a much larger sample.** Fills under five minutes:
453 trades, -$1,950. Every other delay bucket is near flat.

**Asian session is the worst**: 309 trades, -$1,043.

### A defect the run found in this build

The macro repair reported "0 vectors to repair", which was wrong.
`needs_backfill` skipped any vector shorter than the current 38-feature
schema, and **3,359 of 5,000 stored vectors are 33-wide** against 698 at
full width. It was therefore a no-op on 96% of exactly the population
`data-inspect/003` identified.

Fixed: a short vector is now widened with each missing feature's documented
neutral -- through `_feature_schema.pad_to_schema`, the same function
training uses, extracted verbatim so a repaired row and an in-memory padded
one cannot come to mean different things -- and then its macro block is
filled from history. It now reports **4,302 vectors to repair**. Still dry
run by default: applying it changes what the ML gate learns.

The test that pinned the old behaviour was rewritten rather than deleted,
and says why the original expectation was wrong.

---

## Housekeeping, 2026-09-11 16:00

The stale databases were cleared at the owner's request:
`forex_trader.db` (empty since August) and `forex_trader_live.db` (never held
a trade) deleted, the pre-migration backups deleted, and the 25470480
database moved to `data/archive/` rather than destroyed -- it holds 1,398
trades from 21 July to 3 September and several docs cite its numbers.

**That archive move broke the next boot**, because the file it moved was
also the DEFAULT database path, which `account_registry` falls back to on
every startup before the EA has said which account it is. The app created a
fresh empty database and ran on it for about a minute. Verified inert: zero
trades, zero signals, zero templates, every live-execution flag at its
schema default of off, and no positions at the broker.

Fixed by consolidating onto one file -- the live account's database now IS
the default path, and `accounts.json` maps 26004592 to it -- so the fallback
and the resolved path can no longer diverge. Verified after restart: schema
43, 291 trades, 23 templates, `re_live_execution` back at 1, the 289
execution-cost rows intact, and every capability switch still off.

The full write-up is in
[docs/system/domains/data](../../system/domains/data/README.md); it also
explains why the archived database was six migrations behind, which had been
an open puzzle.

Four older `.bak-*` files remain in the data directory, including one from
the in-progress ledger repair. Those are not mine to remove.

---

## The macro repair, applied 2026-09-11 16:16

The owner authorised it. 4,288 of 5,000 stored training vectors repaired;
712 already carried real values. Every stored vector is now 38 wide and
none carries the macro constants.

### It did not work the first time, and the dry run is why that was cheap

The first dry pass reported **4,288 rows with "no data"** and wrote nothing,
which reads exactly like Yahoo having no history for the period. It was not:
`fetch_history` did `row["Close"]` over `df.iterrows()`, and yfinance 1.7
returns **MultiIndex columns** -- `('Close', '^VIX')` -- even for a single
ticker, so that expression yields a one-element Series rather than a float.
`float()` on it raised, the broad `except` swallowed it, and every symbol
came back empty.

A guessed dataframe shape. The seam is now `_closes_from_frame`, tested
against both column layouts, against a NaN row and against a frame with no
Close at all. Second dry pass: 4,288 to repair, **zero** without data.

### What the constants were actually saying

They were not merely uninformative. They were systematically wrong about
the regime the engine was trading in:

| feature | neutral it held | real range in the training set |
|---|---|---|
| `gvz_level` | 0.425 (GVZ 17) | 0.581 to 0.736 (GVZ 23 to 29) |
| `vix_level` | 0.500 (VIX 20) | 0.350 to 0.516 (VIX 14 to 21) |
| `us10y_level` | 0.750 (4.50%) | 0.769 to 0.825 (4.61% to 4.95%) |
| `dxy_momentum` | 0.000 | -1.000 to +0.509, 545 distinct values |
| `tip_momentum` | 0.000 | -1.000 to +1.000, 196 distinct values |

Gold volatility is the clearest: every historical row told the model GVZ
was 17 through a period when it never once dropped below 23. The model was
not just missing the macro picture, it was being given a false one.

### When it takes effect, and what to watch

The model persisted before the repair is still in memory and still scoring
signals. A batch retrain fires every 5 closed signals
(`_RETRAIN_EVERY = 5`), so the repaired data reaches the live gate within
an hour or two of trading, not on restart.

**Watch the block rate.** `_ML_BLOCK_THRESHOLD` is 0.0 and the gate was
already refusing most signals (11% executed on 2026-09-07). If five inputs
going from a false constant to real values changes what it refuses, that
shows up as a step change in the `ml_skipped` count, and the direction is
not predictable from here.

The pre-repair database is at
`reversal_engine.db.pre-macro-repair-20260911-161641` if it needs undoing.

---

## Owner changes, 2026-09-11 17:30

**The capability switches moved** to Signal Generator > Reversal Engine.
They configure that engine, so they belong beside the panel that shows
whether any of them is working.

**Learn From Pro Signals is gone.** No longer used, so
`re_learn_from_ref_signals` stays 0 and `pro_likeness` stays at its neutral
for every signal. `pro_model` itself is untouched and still fitted on the
signal-capture path.

**The panel's numbers were reset.** Before: 5,384 signals, 71.6% win rate,
-$20,282 total, -$19,282 virtual balance, $20,816 max drawdown. After: zero
across the board and the balance back to $1,000.

**No row was deleted.** All 5,384 signals, all 5,384 stored feature vectors
and all 2,904 excursion measurements survive. The reset is a timestamp --
`stats_epoch` -- that the reporting queries filter on. That distinction is
load-bearing: deleting the rows would have taken the ML training set, the
reconstructed excursion data and the whole attribution table with them, and
the excursion half came from broker tick history that reaches back 30 days
and no further.

`get_recent_win_rate` is deliberately NOT filtered: it is a feature in the
model's vector, not a number on a panel. The epoch changes what the user
sees, not what the model learns.

**Recommend and AI** (migration 44, `re_ai_tuning_enabled`, off).

*Recommend* puts the measured evidence in front of the configured AI -- the
fitted barriers, the per-cohort attribution, the measured round-trip cost,
the meta-labeller's verdict on itself, the live spread -- and proposes
settings with a rationale, writing nothing until Apply. First live run,
2026-09-11 17:31, unprompted and unedited:

> re_atr_barriers_enabled -> 1, re_atr_stop_mult -> 1.5, re_atr_tp1_mult -> 2.0
>
> "The fitted barriers show an implied RR of 0.229 (target 0.557 ATR vs stop
> 2.728 ATR), which is far too tight a target against the stop [...] Enabling
> it with a more balanced stop/target addresses the dominant structural cause
> of the negative mean_r across nearly every cohort, while leaving level-type
> blocking and gates alone given the thin or confounded evidence there."

That is the right read of the fit, including the part about not acting on
thin cohorts. It was not applied.

*AI* hands the switches over permanently: every 15 minutes the engine
re-reads the market and applies what the AI returns, with no confirmation.
`ai_tuner.TUNABLE` is a fixed allowlist -- **sizing and live execution are
not on it and never will be by this route** -- every number is clamped to
the range the form allows a human, unparseable output changes nothing, and a
block list covering every level type is rejected because a model that
decides nothing is tradeable has switched the engine off rather than tuned
it.

---

## Better evidence for the AI, 2026-09-11 17:37

The first Recommend proposed a 2.0x ATR target that neither the reach data
nor the exit-policy sweep supports. The model reasoned correctly; it had
only been shown the fitted barriers. Two fixes:

**The sweep sample went from 60 paths to 250** (239 usable). At 60 the
intervals were so wide the sweep could not distinguish any exit rule from
no edge.

**The reach distribution and the sweep now travel with the evidence**,
read from the last study rather than recomputed -- the sweep is hundreds of
bridge round trips and asking for a recommendation must not mean waiting a
minute. The prompt also explains how to read them: the fit is a diagnosis
not a target, a straddling interval is not evidence, and where the three
disagree, prefer changing nothing.

### The reach figure the engine was built on is wrong

Measured on 750 executed trades with tick-reconstructed excursion:

| reaches | share |
|---|---|
| 0.5R | 51.2% |
| **1.0R** | **42.4%** |
| 2.0R | 26.1% |
| 3.0R | 15.7% |

Median 0.562R, mean 1.397R.

`signal_generator.calculate_tp_cascade`'s docstring justifies its short
fixed ladder with "only 9.4% of signals ever travel 1.0R (median 0.43R)".
**The real figure is 42.4%, four and a half times that.** The original was
computed before the live path recorded excursion at all -- of 745 executed
signals only 52 carried an MFE and none after 2026-08-28 -- so it rested on
a small, badly selected sample. The docstring now says so.

This does NOT mean widen the ladder. It means the argument for keeping it
short is much weaker than it reads, and the question is open again.

### And with the full picture, the AI declined

Second run, same button, unedited:

> "No change is justified: the exit sweep's top rows (e.g. stop 2/target 12,
> expectancy 0.346) have confidence intervals straddling zero and split-half
> results that disagree in sign, so they are not evidence. The reach, sweep,
> and fitted-barrier data disagree (median reach is only 0.56R while the
> sweep's best cell needs a 12-point target), and with the meta-labeller
> unfitted and most level types showing small or ambiguous samples, the
> safest action is to change nothing rather than guess."

Verified: five of the six top sweep cells do flip sign between
chronological halves. Given half the evidence it produced a confident
number; given all of it, it refused. That is the behaviour to want from
something allowed to write live settings.

---

## First switch turned on, 2026-09-11 17:50

**`min_fill_delay_enabled` = 1** on demo account 26004592, at the owner's
instruction. The first thing in this whole series that changes what the app
trades. `fill_too_soon` is reached on the live path at
`reversal_engine_live_execute.py:278`, so it is live from the next signal.

### The window is 30 seconds, and the evidence is about 300

`min_fill_delay_s` was already sitting at **30.0**, not the 300 default.
Measured over every executed, closed reversal signal:

| fill delay | n | net | per trade |
|---|---|---|---|
| under 30s (the window in force) | 277 | -$438 | -$1.58 |
| under 300s (what the evidence measures) | 456 | -$1,915 | -$4.20 |
| 300s or slower | 333 | -$229 | -$0.69 |

So the 30-second window catches 277 of the 456 bad fills and only **$438 of
the $1,915**. The worst band is the one it misses entirely: 179 trades
between 30s and 300s carrying $1,476 of loss, **-$8.25 a trade**.

The switch is on with the window untouched, because the 30.0 may have been
chosen deliberately and a changed setting is a question for the owner, not
drift. **Raising it to 300 is the open decision**, and it is the difference
between capturing a quarter of the effect and all of it.

### A save on the Risk card reverted a setting, and it can do it again

Turning the switch on through Trading > Risk also set
`htf_bias_gate_enabled` back to 0. It had been 1 since the owner turned it
on on 2026-09-09, and it is the gate whose own tooltip records trades with
the trend as the only profitable group on the account (+$101 over 369
against -$1,211 over 201). Caught within a minute and restored.

**The mechanism is the hazard, not the incident.** `save_risk()` writes
back EVERY field on the card from whatever the form currently shows, and
the form is built once from a single `get_risk_settings()` read. If that
read is stale for any reason, pressing Save on one checkbox silently
reverts every other setting on the card to whatever the form was built
with. A fresh page load renders correctly, so this is not a permanent
defect in the binding -- which makes it worse, because it will not
reproduce on demand and it leaves no trace.

**The fix worth making**: have the handler re-read current settings at save
time and write only the fields that actually differ from what the form was
built with. Roughly ten lines, on a money path, so it wants its own
test-first change rather than being tacked on here.

Until then: after pressing Save Risk Settings, check the other switches on
that card still say what you meant.


---

## The trend gate is wrong in the Asian session, 2026-09-12

The gate the owner turned on on 2026-09-09 was justified on a measurement
taken across all hours together. Split by session, over all 5,414
`re_signals` rows, it reverses:

| session | with the bias | against it |
|---|---|---|
| asian (00-07 UTC) | n=693, **-$6.26**, CI [-9.40, -3.12] | n=621, -$0.50, CI [-3.69, 2.69] |
| every other | n=1,480, -$1.02, CI [-3.30, 1.27] | n=1,154, **-$4.81**, CI [-7.48, -2.14] |

The two bolded cells hold their sign across chronological halves; the other
two only straddle zero. Outside Asia the gate refuses the group losing $4.81
a trade, which is what it is for. Inside Asia it refuses the group losing
nothing and admits the one losing $6.26 -- about **$5.76 a trade across
1,314 signals**, pointing the wrong way.

**Built: `htf_bias_asian_exempt`** (migration 45, **off**), on the
Capabilities card. It stands the trend rule down for 00-07 UTC and changes
nothing at any other hour. It does NOT invert the rule: -$0.50 with an
interval straddling zero is not an edge, and preferring counter-trend trades
in Asia would be reading a straddling interval as a signal -- the mistake
the AI declined to make on 2026-09-11.

**The caveat this shares with everything else on this page:** almost all of
that P&L is the engine's virtual ledger. Only a minority of signals reach
the broker, so this is the population the engine simulates.

### Two rules, not one, and the first mutation pass caught it

That path refuses a counter-bias trade in two places: the owner's gate, and
the original `level_score < 0.75` bypass beside it (090). While the gate is
on, the second is a strict subset of the first and changes no outcome --
which is exactly why exempting only the gate would have gone unnoticed. It
would have turned the switch into "counter-bias in Asia, but only on levels
scoring 0.75 or better".

The first version of the change was pinned only by a source-shape assertion,
and **a planted mutation removing the exemption from the second clause
survived it**. `tests/reversal_engine/test_asian_bias_exemption_on_the_live_path.py`
runs the branch instead, at level scores 0.60 and 0.95; the 0.60 case is
what kills that mutant. Four mutations were planted in total and all four
are now killed.

### Why the switch is not an argument to `htf_bias_blocks`

The first attempt added `session=` to `governor.htf_bias_blocks`. It was
backed out: six order routes share that function and the evidence above is
Reversal Engine data. `capability_gates.asian_bias_exempt` answers "does
this session opt out at all", the governor rule keeps its signature and all
six callers, and a structural test pins that no other route consults the
exemption.

### Still waiting on you

**Nothing here has been demoed.** Three things are now measured and ready,
in the order they would be turned on:

1. **`session_liquidity_gate_enabled`** (built 2026-09-11, off). Blocks
   Sunday 21:00 UTC to Monday 01:00 UTC. Sunday from 21:00 is 102 signals at
   -$9.10 each; Monday 00:00-00:59 is 67 at -$19.32, CI [-32.47, -6.17],
   both halves negative. -$2,223 inside the hours this gate already covers.
2. **`min_fill_delay_s` 30 -> 300**, the open decision from the section
   above, re-measured 2026-09-12 and confirmed: over executed closed signals
   the 30-300s band is 180 trades at -$8.02 (-$1,443), both halves negative,
   against -$1.58 under 30s and -$0.83 over 300s. It is one band, not a
   gradient, and the window in force catches the cheap end.
3. **`htf_bias_asian_exempt`**, this section.

And the question that is not ours: **the Bounce engine holds the opposite
Asian rule** and has since before any of this was measured. See
[simon-handover/033](../../simon-handover/033-two-engines-disagree-about-the-asian-session.md).

## The study runs nightly, 2026-09-16

### Why

`research_lab.run_study` is the only producer of the reach distribution and
the exit-policy sweep, and the only place they are stored.
`ai_tuner.gather_evidence` READS that stored summary; it has no way to
refresh it. So while the study was button-only, the evidence the tuner
handed a model was however old the last press was.

Measured today: `last_study_summary.ran_at` was **2026-09-12 12:28**, four
days stale, and still being presented as the current reach evidence. That is
the slow-fuse version of the failure already recorded in `ai_tuner`'s
docstring, where the 2026-09-11 run "proposed a 2.0x ATR target that neither
the reach data nor the sweep supports. It reasoned correctly from half a
picture."

The study's input justifies a daily cadence and no more: executed-and-closed
signals went 791 -> 830 over those four days, roughly 2% growth per day.
Hourly would re-fit the same sample.

### What shipped

| piece | where |
|---|---|
| the daily job | `services/reversal_engine/study_schedule.py` (new) |
| wired into the timer that already ticks | `services/reversal_engine/research_loop.py` |
| the tuner reports how old its evidence is | `ai_tuner._note_the_age`, `STALE_AFTER_S = 36h` |
| tests | `tests/reversal_engine/test_study_schedule.py` (new), `TestItSaysHowOldTheEvidenceIs` in `test_ai_tuner.py` |

Guards carried over from the nightly Telegram sweep: local node only, `>= 22`
rather than `== 22` (the drift that left 2026-08-09, 08-14 and 08-15 with no
research row), deduped by the `re_study_last` app_config key. Two are its
own: **no bridge means the day is not marked done**, and **a study that
raises does not mark the day done** -- claiming it either way would burn the
single daily run on a pass that measured nothing, which is the staleness the
schedule exists to stop.

No new asyncio task in `runtime.py`. It shares `research_loop`'s minute
timer, each job with its own try/except so Telegram being down cannot take
the study's day with it.

### Why 22:00 Europe/London

The daily settlement break, not just "late". 17:00 New York is 21:00 UTC
under EDT and 22:00 UTC under EST, and London local tracks that shift both
ways -- which is why the nightly sweep already used London time. Over the
seven days to 2026-09-16, `re_analysis_log` produced **2 signals in the
21:00 UTC hour** against 17-72 in every other hour of the day.

### What was NOT done

- **The study's bridge and database reads are still on the event loop.**
  bugs/030 moved its CPU-heavy arithmetic off on 2026-09-12 and deliberately
  left these where they are. ~250 sequential `get_ticks_range` calls at
  ~0.19s each still saturate the bridge for minutes. They await properly so
  they cannot freeze dispatch the way the 21.5s sweep did, but scheduling
  them into the quiet hour is a mitigation, not a fix.
- **`re_ai_tuning_enabled` is still off** -- it is not even a column in
  `vantage_risk_settings`, so `_ai_tune_loop` is inert and nothing acts on
  the study automatically. This makes the Recommend button honest; it does
  not make the engine self-tuning. Whether an AI may write live capability
  switches unattended is yours, not a side effect of scheduling a report.

Tests were written first and watched fail (`ImportError: cannot import name
'study_schedule'`, then 5 red in `TestItSaysHowOldTheEvidenceIs`). Ten
mutants, each killed, `__pycache__` purged around every restore:

| mutation | result |
|---|---|
| `SLOT_HOUR = 22` -> `0` | 1 failed |
| slot gate removed | 1 failed |
| no-bridge guard removed | 1 failed |
| claims the day after a failure | 2 failed |
| remote-node gate removed | 1 failed |
| dedup removed | 1 failed |
| study not called by the loop | 2 failed |
| staleness never flagged | 2 failed |
| age never reported | 3 failed |
| age helper never called | 4 failed |

One of the new tests passed vacuously on its first run and was rewritten:
`test_the_prompt_tells_it_to_discount_stale_evidence` found `study_note` in
the prompt because `_build_prompt` dumps the evidence dict in verbatim, so it
was matching its own input. It now builds from an empty dict and asserts on
the Notes text.
