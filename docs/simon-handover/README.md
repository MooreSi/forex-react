# Open decisions — the owner's queue

This folder is the answer-later queue. Everything in it is written in plain
English — no programming knowledge needed. It is the record of what the
refactor did, what still needs an owner decision, and what happens next.

## What has been done (in plain English)

**The app now explains itself.** The first time it opens, it shows a "Start
Here" checklist — is the licence active, is MetaTrader connected, is your
risk set — with a button on each unfinished item that takes you to the right
place. There's a "?" help button on every screen, every tab has a plain
description, and the About page is now organised into "set up once" and
"every day".

**It can run in a safe practice mode.** The whole app can now start with no
trading account, no Telegram, no internet — it generates pretend prices and
pretend signals so you can watch it find a trade, open it, manage it and
close it, with no possibility of real money moving. A big amber "DEBUG MODE"
banner makes it impossible to confuse with the real thing. One small switch
that connects this practice mode into the app is deliberately left for you
to approve (see "What we need from you").

**The plumbing is sturdier.** Database upgrades now happen in careful
numbered steps that have been tested against old copies of the data, daily
backups are taken automatically, and the dashboard only accepts connections
from the computer it runs on. The automated tests that guard the app were
audited — tests that looked like protection but actually checked nothing
were removed and are now impossible to reintroduce.

**The safety brake was reviewed.** The "circuit breaker" (which pauses new
trades after a run of losses) is well designed — it survives restarts, works
across both machines, and never closes your open positions. Two improvements
were identified and are waiting for your go-ahead: it currently ships
switched OFF by default, and one failure it should shout about it currently
only whispers.

**Nothing about how it trades has changed.** Every change above is about
usability, plumbing and testing. The rules of this project say that anything
touching real orders — opening, closing, sizing — needs the owner to approve
it and watch it demonstrated. That work is prepared and waiting (see below).

## What we need from you — step by step

> **Status update, 2026-08-25: Step 1 is done.** All five decision files are
> answered and Part A of the session agenda is closed. Three of the questions
> turned out to rest on premises that were false or out of date, and the answers
> record what was actually found. See [questions.md](questions.md) for the
> summary and the nine follow-up items the answers authorise.

**Step 1 — Answer the questions (about 30 minutes, no computer skills
needed).** Open [session-agenda.md](session-agenda.md) and work down Part A.
Each row links to one of the numbered files in this folder; open the file,
read "The question" and the recommendation, and type your answer on the
**Answer:** line (in any text editor — even Notepad). *"Confirm — keep what
you chose"* is a complete answer for every one of them.

**Step 2 — The demo session on your machine.** After your answers, the
money-safety work gets built, and each protection is demonstrated on the
**demo** account (never the live one) before it ships — one position instead
of two on a timeout, no phantom closes, the safety brake on by default. The
agenda's Part B lists exactly what gets watched.

## How to run the app

**The safe way first — practice mode (no keys, no account, no internet):**
open a terminal in the app folder and run:

```
set FOREX_DEBUG_MODE=1
python run.py
```

then open **http://localhost:8890** in your browser and log in with
username `debug`, password `debug`. Everything you see is simulated — the
amber banner across the top confirms it. This is the best way to explore
without any risk at all.

**The real app:**

```
python run.py
```

then open **http://localhost:8888**. The first thing to do there is follow
the **Start Here** checklist that pops up — it checks each requirement
(licence, MetaTrader connected, risk set) and its "Fix this →" buttons take
you to the right screen for each one.

**Where your keys and accounts go** — all inside the app, under
**Settings**:

- **MetaTrader:** Settings → *MT5 / Bridge* — your account login, password
  and server (demo and live are entered separately; the app starts in demo).
- **Telegram signals** (optional): Settings → *Telegram Alerts*, plus the
  Parsing tab to connect channels. Creating the Telegram API key is a
  one-time step — the app's **About → Setup Instructions** walks it through
  click by click.
- **AI commentary** (optional): Settings → *AI* — your Anthropic key.
- **Email reports** (optional): Settings → *Email Reports*.

Nothing needs editing in files — every key is entered through those screens,
and the **? Help button** (top right, any screen) opens a guide that links
to all of this. If anything is unclear, that is a bug in the docs — the doc
gets fixed, not you.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| [session-agenda.md](session-agenda.md) | The agenda for your two sittings — decisions, then demos |
| [questions.md](questions.md) | The decision queue: how it works and the full list |
| `001, 002, 004, 005, 007` | Your five decisions, one file each — options spelled out, you write on the **ANSWER:** lines |
| [what-the-refactor-gave-you.md](what-the-refactor-gave-you.md) | What the refactor actually changed — better, cost, and still outstanding |
| [readiness-checklist.md](readiness-checklist.md) | The honest "is it ready?" scorecard — what's green, what's not, and why |
| [future-roadmap.md](future-roadmap.md) | Ideas for what comes next — not commitments, a menu |

## The one-line summary

The app is easier to use, safer to change, provably testable, and can be
demonstrated end-to-end without risking a penny — and the only work left
before you can trust it live is the work that was always going to need you
in the room.

- [010-session-2026-08-28-evening.md](010-session-2026-08-28-evening.md) — what got done while you were out, and the two things that now need you
- [011-your-halt-settings-do-not-match-what-you-confirmed.md](011-your-halt-settings-do-not-match-what-you-confirmed.md) — your risk governor is off and your daily-loss limit is 20%, not the 3% you confirmed
- [012-should-a-resting-order-use-a-trade-slot.md](012-should-a-resting-order-use-a-trade-slot.md) — resting pending orders do not count toward max_open_trades; A/B/C on whether they should
- **[013-the-five-demos-runbook.md](013-the-five-demos-runbook.md) — START HERE for the demo session.** All five money-path fixes, step by step on a demo account, about 40 minutes. Nothing in stage 3 is finished until these are run.
- [014-a-wildcard-fingerprint-nothing-uses.md](014-a-wildcard-fingerprint-nothing-uses.md) — a one-word answer needed: does your KeyGen define `TEST_WILDCARD`?
- [015-session-2026-08-31.md](015-session-2026-08-31.md) — what got done on 31 August, the two things that were actually broken, and the three that need you
- [016-the-native-bridge-has-the-same-shape.md](016-the-native-bridge-has-the-same-shape.md) — **answered, no decision needed**: yes the bridge is still required with the EA, and it turned out to be the one your Windows machine actually uses
- [017-which-clock-is-your-trading-schedule-in.md](017-which-clock-is-your-trading-schedule-in.md) — **answered and done**: the Trading Schedule now reads UK time on both machines, with no new dependency
- [018-the-partial-close-can-pay-twice.md](018-the-partial-close-can-pay-twice.md) — **answered and done**: one partial per TP level per trade. Check for any `_dup` rows after your next start — those are places this bug already fired
- **[019-editing-a-pending-signal-used-the-wrong-rows-numbers.md](019-editing-a-pending-signal-used-the-wrong-rows-numbers.md) — no decision needed, but worth reading.** Save on any pending-signal row used the LAST row's numbers; if you ever saw "Saved" appear on the wrong row, that was this
- [020-out-of-hours-still-runs-on-utc.md](020-out-of-hours-still-runs-on-utc.md) — a small consistency question: your Trading Schedule now follows UK time, Out of Hours still follows UTC. May well be right as it is
- [027-what-should-a-direction-only-message-do.md](027-what-should-a-direction-only-message-do.md) — a "BUY" with no numbers: ignore it, show it, or hold it open? A/B/C with a recommendation. The noise and the wasted work are already fixed; this is only what you want to SEE

- [028-sharing-the-engines-learning-with-every-client.md](028-sharing-the-engines-learning-with-every-client.md) — should every client learn from every other client? Two decisions, neither urgent, and a recommendation to wait until the engine is worth copying

- [031-should-a-stopped-out-trade-be-held-instead.md](031-should-a-stopped-out-trade-be-held-instead.md) — a stop-out followed seconds later by the same trade at a better price: should the app widen the stop and hold instead? Measured over 91 pairs; the answer is no, and what to do instead

- [032-a-trade-can-carry-twice-the-risk-the-template-says.md](032-a-trade-can-carry-twice-the-risk-the-template-says.md) — one -$120.30 stop on a day of -$50 stops, traced: nothing broke, the stop was simply wider than the template says. How often, what it has cost, and four options

- [039-cme-futures-context-is-free-is-it-worth-building.md](039-cme-futures-context-is-free-is-it-worth-building.md) — dark pools do not exist for gold; CME futures are the honest version, and the daily data is free. A switch is in, off and connected to nothing. The question is whether to spend a session measuring if futures flow predicts anything here

- [040-volatility-sizing-would-have-lost-more-not-less.md](040-volatility-sizing-would-have-lost-more-not-less.md) — measured over 5,116 closed signals before wiring it: volatility targeting would have lost $1,113 MORE, and the drawdown half is pinned at its floor permanently. Recommendation: leave it off
