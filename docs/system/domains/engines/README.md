# Engines

**Living file — update when this domain teaches you something.**
Covers: `backend/src/services/breakout_signal/`, `reversal_engine/`,
`backtest/`.

## What it is

Two independent research engines each generate their own XAUUSD signals,
track them virtually, learn from outcomes, and — only when their own
live-execution toggle is on — place real MT5 orders through the main engine:

- **Breakout** — trend-following break-and-go / break-and-retest
- **Reversal Engine** — Gold Diggers VIP / GD2 ICT emulation

There were three. **Bounce / TestSignal** (mean-reversion off key levels) lost
its panel on 2026-09-02, was stopped on 2026-09-13 and was deleted on
2026-09-14 — `docs/todo/bugs/046` is the whole arc. Its name still occupies
position 1 of 3 in `engines_controller._ENGINE_SERVICES`, bound to `None`,
because the sync protocol binds engines by that fixed order.

Each owns an isolated SQLite database, its own adaptive parameters, and its
own ML model, with no cross-training. A separate backtest package replays
recorded candles against the live strategy management rules.

## Where the code lives

- `services/market/` — the primitives both engines share, owned by neither: `sessions.py` (`get_session`, `session_quality`, `session_is_active`), `levels.py` (`compute_htf_bias`, `identify_key_levels`, `is_news_window`), `indicators.py` (`compute_h4_bias`, `compute_adx`, `compute_macd_hist`, `detect_regime`), `macro_context.py` (yfinance), `news_window.py` (Forex Factory). All five were inside `test_signal/` until 2026-09-14, which is why deleting that package had to be a move first and a delete second.
- `services/breakout_signal/` — same shape: orchestrator, manage/live_execute/velocity/learn, generator, `bo_config` params, 22-feature ML, `bo_`-prefixed store, and `backtest.py` (walk-forward harness)
- `services/reversal_engine/` — orchestrator (levels → pending zone signals → trigger → outcomes → REF correlation), TP1–TP8 ladder management, live execute, `level_detector.py` / `ict_patterns.py` (FVG-iFVG-sweep-breaker "Unicorn"), nightly 22:00 Europe/London Telegram+image research sweep, dual-axis ML, `re_`-prefixed store
- `services/backtest/engine.py` / `simulators.py` / `repo.py` — XAUUSD backtest engine, per-strategy `_simulate_*` walkers, main-DB signal reads

## Constraints / must not change

- **The two engines do not share a word for "this one actually traded" (2026-09-16, bugs/062).** `re_signals.live_exec_status` carries `'executed'`; `bo_signals` carries `'success'`, plus `skipped:*` and `failed:*`. The breakout `measure_repo` was modelled on the reversal engine's and kept `'executed'`, so all three excursion queries matched zero rows — on 124 stored signals and on every future one. Nothing caught it: the tests shared the literal with the query, and the mutants only ever varied code that was internally consistent. **Isolation between the engines is not only the databases — it is the vocabulary.** Copying a query from one engine to the other means re-checking every literal in it against what that engine writes. The value now has a name, `breakout_signal_repo.LIVE_EXEC_SUCCESS`; three sites on the order path still spell it out and its comment lists them.

- **`bo_signals.atr_m15` holds an M5 ATR (2026-09-16, bugs/063).** The breakout engine fetches M5 only and computes `compute_atr(m5_candles[-20:], 14)`. Every consumer uses it consistently, so nothing is miscalculated — but the AI reviewer's prompt states it as `ATR(M15)`, which is a claim the model cannot check, and the column name misleads anyone reading the table. Measured over the same 300-minute span on 2026-09-16: ATR(M5)=16.27 against ATR(M15)=19.93. The column name stays; the prompt label is the owner's call because that gate can veto a signal.

- **Total isolation between engines**: separate SQLite DBs (`breakout_signal.db`, `reversal_engine.db`), no shared tables or connections, no cross-contamination of ML labels or params. `test_signal.db` still exists on disk and still holds the Bounce engine's 173 signals; nothing reads it but `analytics/signal_lab_repo.py`.
- Each engine has exactly one real-money surface file (`*_live_execute.py`), gated on its own live-execution toggle. Everything else is virtual tracking with read-only bridge access.
- Adaptive params: every Claude-recommended value is clamped to its `[min, max]` envelope before being applied — "the engine never operates outside the safe envelope."
- Backtest design principles: signals tested only forward from creation time; pre-filtered to the loaded candle window; corrupt signals rejected up front; lot size recomputed on current equity after every trade; commission always deducted.
- `backtest/engine.py`'s Reversal Runner constants must stay in sync with the live `_GDVR_*` values; `simulators.py` is imported lazily to avoid an import cycle.
- `reversal_engine` implements only publicly documented ICT definitions from plain OHLC — no proprietary indicator code.

## Known things & gotchas

- **The Reversal Engine ML version history, and why a bump used to be dangerous (moved here from `ml_engine.py` 2026-09-08).** That file sits on the 800-line ceiling, and this is rationale rather than code. Each bump discards the fitted models because a changed feature width or label makes the old ones invalid; **the training DATA is never lost** — `_collect_training_data` re-reads every closed signal from the database and right-pads older rows with `_FEATURE_NEUTRAL`. What a bump used to cost was the model itself until the next retrain, and that window was dangerous because **the ML gate fails OPEN**: `reversal_engine_live_execute` blocks only `if fresh_prob is not None and < 0`, and `predict()` returns None with no model, so every signal executed unfiltered. v9 shipped Saturday 2026-09-05 and the first v9 retrain was Monday 09:27. Since 2026-09-08 `ml_handover.py` hands the previous model over instead — it keeps scoring the leading features it was fitted on (valid because features are append-only) until a retrain replaces it, and **only from v5**, because v5 replaced the label and an older model predicts a different quantity that the gate would compare to zero. The per-version history:

```
  v3 switches to R-multiple regression and adds 4 new features (news_proximity_norm,
  regime_score, equity_drawdown_pct, concurrent_agreement) — discards v2 models so
  dimension and label format mismatches can't happen; retrains from scratch.
  v4 adds ref_discipline_score/ref_aggression_score — daily values derived by
  telegram_research.py's nightly AI read of the reference channel/GD2 messages+images, cached
  in re_config and refreshed once per night. Same discard-and-retrain-from-
  scratch handling as v3 for the same reason (dimension mismatch).
  v5 (2026-07-31) keeps v4's features but replaces the LABEL: was
  `rr_tp1 if win else -1.0`, now realised net R (see _realised_r). The old
  label was a fiction -- it priced every loss at exactly -1.0R and every win
  at its planned rr_tp1, so summed over the 576 closed signals it read +51.1
  ("profitable") while the same trades actually lost $2,691 (sum of realised
  R: -46.1). Measured against real rows: losses averaged -1.22R (worst
  -5.75R, stops slipping well past sl_dist) and wins +0.39R, a true payoff of
  0.32:1 versus the 0.54:1 the model was being told. Retrained from scratch
  because a model fitted on the old label is calibrated to the wrong scale.
  v8 (2026-08-06) appends `pro_likeness` -- the output of pro_model.py, a
  classifier trained on "a reference channel fired here" vs "background", so
  what the professionals do enters this model as ONE weighted opinion rather
  than as training rows of its own (their signals have no realised R of ours
  to regress against, and pooling them would answer a different question with
  the same weights). Same discard-and-retrain handling as v3-v7: the stored
  vectors are back-filled to the new width by _FEATURE_NEUTRAL, so the
  training history survives even though the fitted models do not.
  v9 (2026-09-05) appends the five macro series Bounce and Breakout already
  read -- DXY, US10Y, VIX, GVZ, TIP -- normalised in re_macro.py (which says
  why there). Discard-and-retrain as v3-v8. Spec: docs/todo/001-reversal-macro-context.md.
```
- Reversal correlation is **asymmetric on purpose**: our signals fire as price *approaches* a level, the REF channel posts when it *arrives*, so legitimate matches lead by 10–30 minutes. The old symmetric ±300s window failed 498 of 511 matches. `correlation_time_delta_s` is signed: negative = we fired first (good).
- Reversal session is 04:00–16:00 UTC, measured from 591 real REF signals. Asia range is a *level source*, not a trading session. Signal expiry is 2 hours.
- Known bug class in `reversal_engine_manage.py`: `sig["strategy"]` overwritten after `build_signal()` tagged it `"gd2_unicorn"`, so GD2 signals silently fell through to the REF 8-level ladder branch.
- `breakout_signal_repo.py` **deliberately preserves** a known `close_signal` balance double-counting bug (proven by characterization test) — the port's scope was no-behaviour-change.
- Breakout ADX thresholds were rebuilt 2026-07-16 after a ratchet forced every entry into late trends (the 40+ bucket lost $1,258 over 191 trades); floor lowered to 28 go / 24 retest, lateness moved to `max_adx_entry` + `require_adx_rising`.
- `breakout_signal/backtest.py` exists because nightly AI tuning on small recent samples once ratcheted the engine into a losing configuration with no counterfactual check. It omits news windows, spread gate, Claude review and the ML gate — all only *remove* trades, so live selectivity ≥ backtest selectivity.
- Backtest intrabar tie-break is conservative: SL fills before TP within the same M1 bar. Max hold 96 bars, lots clamped 0.01–5.0, $100/point/lot.
- Reversal live execution is blocked when the predicted R-multiple is below 0.
- Three modules read the core DB cross-engine — flagged as inherent coupling preserved as-is.
- All three `panel_data.py` modules transparently swap to mirrored remote stats when the VPS is the active trader.
- `test_signal/auth.py` bakes the hardware fingerprint into the PBKDF2 salt — a password hash from one machine can never verify on another.
- **`test_signal/market_context.py`'s 15-minute cache never worked** (fixed 2026-09-05). `_get_hourly_closes` stored only the last close as a packed float, so the hit branch could not rebuild the list it returns and fell through to a re-fetch every time — the comment on that line admitted it. Every `get_context()` was five live yfinance round trips. Breakout survived it by calling once per signal creation. It now caches the whole `_FETCH_WINDOW`-long list per symbol, so one fetch serves every caller whatever `n` they ask for.
- **Reversal ML v9 (2026-09-05) adds the five macro series** Bounce and Breakout already read — DXY, US10Y, VIX, GVZ, TIP — via `reversal_engine/re_macro.py`. They are **normalised there, not at the call site** as breakout does it, because the Reversal model fits an SGDRegressor alongside LightGBM and SGD is scale-sensitive. `MACRO_NEUTRAL` therefore holds *normalised* values: it is merged into `_FEATURE_NEUTRAL`, which right-pads the stored 33-wide vectors, and raw units there would tell the model the ten-year sat off the top of the scale for every historical signal.
- Macro values are **not `re_signals` columns** — the vector is persisted whole as `ml_features_json`. So a row read back at fill time carries no macro, and `reversal_engine_live_execute` must re-read it or its "same feature set" re-score silently differs from the creation-time vector in five slots. Same trap `rsi14` fell into. Pinned by `tests/reversal_engine/test_macro_call_sites.py`.
- **`reversal_engine/ml_engine` is a package as of 2026-09-11**, `__init__.py` 635 lines against `LOC_CEILING = 800`. It reached 785 and is not baselined, so the ceiling could not be raised for it; the fleet-model work (reversal-engine/070) edits `predict()` and had nowhere to go. **Only two seams were taken, and the reason the rest were not is the important part:** `__init__` rebinds six module globals — `_model_batch`, `_model_online`, `_labeled_count`, `_ref_level_stats`, `_train_history`, `_data_dir` — across thirteen functions, and splitting a module that rebinds a global forks that state (rules/70 §5). What moved is what touches none of it: `_feature_schema.py` (the names and neutrals, needed by two importers) and `_training_data.py` (the label and the training set). `extract_features` stayed, because it sits with the state. Everything is re-exported, so `ml_engine.FEATURE_NAMES` and `ml_engine._realised_r` still resolve and every existing test passed unmodified.
- `re_macro.get_cycle_context()` is async and thread-offloaded. The Reversal cycle is 60s and shares its event loop with position management, so a blocking HTTP call in it is not cosmetic.
- **A feature added to an engine cannot be judged by its importance at the retrain that introduces it.** The back-fill gives every historical row the same neutral, so the new column has zero variance and the tree cannot split on it — importance is zero by construction, before any question about the market is asked. Applies to all three engines' `_FEATURE_NEUTRAL` padding, not just Reversal. Pinned with its control in `tests/reversal_engine/test_ml_v9_retrain.py`. **What tells you when it IS readable is a count, not a date (2026-09-11):** the stored vectors whose tail differs from `_FEATURE_NEUTRAL`. For v9 macro that reached **632 of 5,293 labelled rows (12%)** six days after the bump, at which point `dxy_momentum` ranks **7 of 38** by both split and gain — so the "all five land in the bottom quartile" outcome did not happen. Read that table knowing three things: importance is not predictive value (`level_score` is this engine's standing counter-example), a continuous feature attracts splits by cardinality alone, and 88% of the rows are still the neutral constant. `docs/todo/001-reversal-macro-context.md` §9 carries the numbers.
- **The ML gate fails open when there is no model at all** — a fresh install, or a handover refused across the label epoch (below v5). `reversal_engine_live_execute` blocks only `if fresh_prob is not None and < 0`, and `fresh_prob` starts as the creation-time `ml_prob`, which is None when nothing was fitted. `ml_handover` closed the *version-bump* window, which is narrower than "the gate no longer fails open" — a phrase used in the 2026-09-09 session note and worth not repeating.

## Open questions

- Database consolidation across engines (QUESTIONS.md #6) — the raw-sqlite3 cross-engine read is "worth a future pack" once revisited.
- Whether the preserved breakout balance double-counting bug should now be fixed.

## Reversal engine: the 2026-09-11 capability build

`docs/todo/reversal-engine/210` is the inventory. The things worth knowing
here rather than there:

- **The engine no longer copies Gold Diggers** (owner, 2026-09-11 --
  `docs/simon-handover/029`). `signal_generator`'s fixed TP cascade and
  level-score stop are the channel's geometry; `atr_barriers` replaces both
  with volatility multiples when `re_atr_barriers_enabled` is on. It is off.
  `score_level`'s type weights are still calibrated against the channel's
  hit rate and were deliberately left alone.
- **`use_dynamic_atr` is implemented in Python, not the EA.**
  `trading/template_levels.template_sl_at` sizes the stop and
  `open_trade.resolve_template_tps` sizes TP1. The EA reads resolved prices
  and knows nothing about ATR. A grep of `ForexTraderBridge.mq5` for "ATR"
  finds only the display panel, which reads like a missing feature and is
  not one.
- **`cycle_setup.py` holds the per-cycle context and the extra levels**, not
  the service. The service was five lines under its 800-line ceiling.
- **The new gates all live behind `risk/capability_gates.py`**, which is the
  one place the switches are read. A settings row missing those columns
  entirely behaves exactly as it did.
- **The live path records a shadow decision for five variants on every fill
  attempt**, from facts it has already computed. The liquidity gate moved to
  sit beside the other two new gates so all three are evaluated before any
  of them returns -- otherwise a challenger gets recorded as "would take" on
  a signal whose later gates were never run.
- **The research study runs nightly, and the tuner now says how old it is**
  (2026-09-16). `research_lab.run_study` is the only producer of the reach
  distribution and the exit-policy sweep, and `ai_tuner.gather_evidence` can
  only READ the stored summary -- it cannot refresh it. While the study was
  button-only it went four days stale (last run 2026-09-12) and the tuner
  kept presenting that sweep as the current reach evidence, which is the
  slow-fuse version of the 2026-09-11 failure already recorded in
  `ai_tuner`'s own docstring: a 2.0x ATR target proposed from half a picture.
  `study_schedule.py` now runs it once a day from the minute timer
  `research_loop` already owns, deduped by the `re_study_last` app_config key
  and gated to the local node, and `gather_evidence` reports
  `study_age_hours` on every pass plus a `study_note` past 36 hours.
  **The schedule does not make the engine self-tuning** -- `_ai_tune_loop` is
  still inert behind `re_ai_tuning_enabled`, which is not even a column in
  `vantage_risk_settings`, so nothing acts on the study automatically. It
  makes the Recommend button honest.
- **22:00 Europe/London is the settlement break, not just "late"** (2026-09-16).
  17:00 New York is 21:00 UTC under EDT and 22:00 UTC under EST, and London
  local tracks that shift both ways, which is why both nightly jobs use
  London time rather than UTC. Over the seven days to 2026-09-16 the engine's
  `re_analysis_log` produced **2 signals in the 21:00 UTC hour** against 17-72
  in every other hour. That is the mitigation for the study's bridge load and
  the limit is worth stating: bugs/030 moved the study's CPU-heavy arithmetic
  off the loop on 2026-09-12 and deliberately left its database and bridge
  reads on it. ~250 sequential `get_ticks_range` calls at ~0.19s each still
  saturate the bridge for minutes; they await properly so they cannot freeze
  dispatch, but scheduling them into the quiet hour is not the same as making
  them cheap.
- **`ai_tuner.auto_tune` logs every pass, including the ones that change
  nothing** (2026-09-14). It used to log only an APPLIED setting, which made
  four different outcomes identical silence: the model weighed the evidence
  and declined, the provider was down, the response could not be parsed, and
  `sanitise` dropped the whole proposal. On a loop that runs every fifteen
  minutes against an engine with `re_live_execution` on, that is the
  difference between a working tuner and a dead one. `_ai_tune_loop` still
  discards `result["error"]` -- the log line is inside `auto_tune`, where the
  rationale actually is, which also keeps the service under its ceiling.
- **Until then, the only way to prove the tuner had run was the httpx log.**
  `gather_evidence` leaves a signature immediately before its provider POST:
  `GET /candles/XAUUSD?timeframe=H1&count=60`, then `GET /ticks?from=…&to=…`
  over a 900-second window, then `GET /tick/XAUUSD`. Matching those against
  engine-start + n*900s is how the 2026-09-14 session confirmed two live
  passes that had written nothing and said nothing. Worth keeping: the same
  trick identifies any loop that calls an AI provider.
- **Neither `reversal_ai_apply` nor the Save Tuning button logs
  anything**, so a switch that changed cannot be attributed to the AI or to
  the owner after the fact. Only the absence of an `[RE-AI]` line rules the
  tuner out. Not fixed -- recorded because it cost a session's worth of
  inference to establish once.

## The reporting epoch (2026-09-11)

`reversal_engine/stats_repo.stats_epoch()` is a timestamp; every number on
the Reversal Engine panel ignores anything closed before it, and
`reset_stats()` moves it to now and puts the virtual balance back to
$1,000. **It deletes nothing.**

Two consequences worth knowing before touching either side:

- `reconcile_balance_with_trades()` is epoch-filtered, because it runs on
  every `init()` and would otherwise silently restore the pre-reset balance
  at the next restart -- the reset would look as though it had never
  happened.
- `get_recent_win_rate()` is deliberately NOT filtered. It is a feature in
  the model'''s vector, not a number on a panel, and a reporting reset must
  not quietly change what the model is told about the market. Anything else
  added to the panel should follow the same split: reporting reads the
  epoch, features do not.


## The Bounce engine's three counter-trend gates (2026-09-12)

`test_signal_generate.generate` refuses a trigger it has already found in three
places, and until now all three were inline boolean expressions inside a method
that cannot be called without candles, a bridge and a database. Nothing tested
them; the package sits at 25.6% coverage. They are now
`services/test_signal/_gates.py` — `extreme_trend_blocks`, `dual_bias_blocks`,
`asian_counter_bias_blocks` — each returning the reason it refused or None,
which is the shape `risk/governor.htf_bias_blocks` and `risk/capability_gates`
already use.

**Behaviour is unchanged and that is a fact, not a reading.**
`tests/test_signal/test_generate_gates.py` evaluates the original expressions,
copied verbatim from before the move, against the extracted functions over
every combination of their inputs (150 for the Asian gate, 720 each for the
other two). Four mutants killed. A fifth survives and is equivalent: the
`htf_bias == "neutral"` guard in the Asian gate is redundant against
`_is_counter_bias`, kept because the original carried it, and flagged in a
comment so nobody re-derives that.

The three are easy to confuse and differ in ways that matter:

| | fires on | direction | a liquidity sweep |
|---|---|---|---|
| `extreme_trend_blocks` | H1+H4 agree, ADX >= tunable | ignored | **refused too** |
| `dual_bias_blocks` | H1+H4 agree, ADX >= tunable | counter only | exempt |
| `asian_counter_bias_blocks` | the Asian session | counter only | exempt |

The sweep asymmetry is deliberate: a sweep's premise is a level holding against
the crowd, and the extreme-trend gate exists precisely because levels stop
holding in a persistent trend.

**The open question, now visible.** `asian_counter_bias_blocks` refuses
counter-bias signals in this engine's Asian session and has done since before
anything was measured. Note the two engines do not agree on when that is:
`market/sessions.get_session` calls **23:00-07:59** Asian, and
`reversal_engine/level_detector.get_session` calls it **00:00-07:59**. The
23:00 hour is in one engine's rule and outside the other's. The Reversal Engine's own numbers over the same hours
say the opposite — see the risk domain README and
`capability_gates.asian_bias_exempt`. The two engines trade different setups,
so it is possible both are right; nothing on this engine was changed on the
strength of the other's data. It is the owner's call:
`docs/simon-handover/033`.

## The engines were not as isolated as the top of this file said (2026-09-12, resolved 2026-09-14)

> *"Each owns an isolated SQLite database, its own adaptive parameters, and its
> own ML model, with no cross-training."*

The databases and the models are isolated. **The adaptive parameters are not.**

`breakout_signal/signal_generator.py` re-exports `session_quality` and
`session_is_active` from `test_signal/signal_generator.py`, and
`session_quality` reads `ap.get("allow_asian")` — a **Bounce** parameter, held
in the **Bounce** database, written by the **Bounce** engine's Claude tuner
from **Bounce** trade outcomes. The only live caller is
`breakout_signal_velocity.py:55`, in the Breakout engine.

Today it changes nothing at either engine, for two separate reasons, and that
is its own problem: the Bounce engine never calls either function (its
session rule is inline, now `_gates.asian_counter_bias_blocks`), and the
Breakout velocity monitor refuses the Asian session unconditionally on the line
after it asks. So the parameter is tuned, clamped, logged to the learning
history, and connected to nothing. `docs/todo/bugs/045`.

The comment above those imports said *"pure functions with no side effects,
importing is safe and DRY"*. It was true of `compute_adx` and the rest of that
list. It was not true of `session_quality`, which read another engine's store.

**Resolved 2026-09-14 by deleting the Bounce engine.** `session_quality` is now
in `market/sessions.py` and reads no parameter at all: the stored `0.0` is a
named constant, `ASIAN_SESSION_QUALITY = "low"`, preserving today's behaviour
exactly. The claim at the top of this file is now true of the two engines that
remain — they share `services/market/`, which is pure functions over candles
and holds no engine's state.

The lesson generalises past this instance: **a function one engine imports from
another engine's package is a coupling whatever its docstring says.** The tell
here was not the import, which looked harmless, but that one of the ten names
in it reached for a store. Nine did not. Reviewing the list as a list is how
that survived for months.

## The ICT chain, and a hole in its first stage (2026-09-12)

`reversal_engine/ict_patterns.py` is four decisions in a row —
`detect_equal_levels` → `detect_liquidity_sweep` →
`detect_market_structure_shift` → FVG/breaker confluence — and
`find_unicorn_setup` runs all four. Its output becomes a real order: this is
the only engine with live execution on. It sat at 56.6% coverage with the whole
chain untested; `tests/reversal_engine/test_ict_pattern_chain.py` now covers it
(21 cases, seven mutants killed).

Things worth knowing, found by writing them:

- **`detect_equal_levels` cannot see exactly equal highs.** The candidate list
  goes through `set()`, so two candles whose highs round to the same 0.1
  collapse to one value and the pool never forms. 110.0 + 110.4 is a pool;
  110.0 + 110.0 is nothing. `docs/todo/bugs/047` — not fixed, because dropping
  the `set()` changes which pools exist and rescales every touch count on the
  live path.
- **The sweep test is close-back, not wick-through.** A candle that pokes
  through a pool and closes beyond it is a break, and is deliberately not a
  sweep — trading it as a reversal would be trading into a trend.
- **The two filters fail in opposite directions, on purpose.**
  `detect_market_structure_shift` fails CLOSED on insufficient history (it is a
  confirmation: no evidence means no shift), while the breakout engine's
  `_adx_rising` fails OPEN (it is a veto, and one that blocks when it cannot
  judge stops the engine trading at all).
- **`find_unicorn_setup` gives up rather than quoting a zone it does not
  believe.** A confluence wider than 15 points or narrower than 0.5 falls back
  to the FVG's own bounds, and if that fails the same test it returns None.

## What the champion/challenger shadow log can and cannot answer (2026-09-12)

`reversal_engine/shadow.record_all` sits deep inside `_live_execute`, below the
bias gate, the ML floor, the momentum gate, the exposure guard, the schedule,
the news blackout and the fill-delay check, and above the liquidity gate, the
entry trigger and the meta-label gate. That position is deliberate and the code
says why: recording at each early return would log "would take" for a variant
whose later gates never ran, which reads as an endorsement it never gave.

**The consequence is not written down anywhere, so here it is: a challenger can
only differ on the last three gates.** Any variant whose difference is upstream
— a different bias policy, a different ML floor placement, a different schedule
— never sees the signals it would have decided differently about, because those
signals returned before the recorder. The log cannot say it was wrong; it
cannot say anything at all.

That bears directly on `docs/simon-handover/033`. The Asian-session exemption
is a **bias gate** variant, which is upstream. Shadow-logging it would produce
nothing, whichever way it was set, so a live demo session really is the only
way to attribute it — which is what that file recommends, now for a second
reason.

State as of 2026-09-12: 60 rows, 12 signals, all on 2026-09-11 between 14:31
and 18:45 (the afternoon it shipped). Three of the five arms — `confirmed
entries`, `liquidity aware`, `meta 0.55` — have **not disagreed with the
champion once**. Only `ML floor 0.50` differs, refusing six of the twelve. So
the comparison is not yet discriminating between four of its five arms, and a
reader glancing at it should know the sample is one afternoon rather than a
week.

## The card is "Reversal Engine Tuning", and one switch on it is inert (2026-09-17)

Renamed from "Reversal Engine Capabilities" at the owner's request. The
label lives in `frontend/pages/reversal_panel/_capabilities.py` (file name
unchanged) and is pinned as a render landmark in
`tests/frontend/test_remaining_pages_render.py`. Two docs that named the old
path were corrected in the same change; `docs/todo/reversal-engine/210`
keeps the old name as history with a note, because it is a record of what
was built rather than a description of what is there now.

**`re_cme_context_enabled` (migration 46) is wired to nothing, deliberately.**
`capability_gates.cme_context_enabled` is its only reader and nothing
consumes that reader. The reason it stops there is not effort:

- Spot XAUUSD on this broker publishes bid/ask and no Last, so there is no
  trade side, and every "volume" in this system is tick volume — a count of
  quote changes, not size. `services/market/order_flow.py` already carries
  this, and labels each result with the method that produced it.
- CME GC futures are the lit venue where gold prints real size, and the only
  route from proxy to measurement. Dark pools are an equities construct
  (off-exchange prints reported to a regulator's tape) and do not exist for
  spot gold at all — worth knowing, because it is asked.
- **Cost is not the blocker.** Daily GC volume and open interest are
  published free by CME; only real-time streaming is a paid entitlement and
  this engine has no use for it. The blocker is that nothing here has
  measured whether futures flow predicts anything about these trades, so
  the ingest would be built on a guess. Recorded in
  `docs/simon-handover/039-cme-futures-context-is-free-is-it-worth-building.md`.

Same shape as `vol_target_sizing_enabled`, which has been on this card
un-connected since 2026-09-11. The risk with an inert switch is that
somebody later believes it did something, so the tooltip says "no CME feed"
and "changes nothing" in the app, and
`tests/risk/test_cme_context_switch.py::TestTheCardDoesNotOverclaim` fails
if either phrase is removed.

**It is not in `ai_tuner.TUNABLE`**, and should not be. The tuner argues
from this account's own measured trade history; there is no CME evidence for
it to argue from, so the switch would be a coin flip with a rationale
attached.
