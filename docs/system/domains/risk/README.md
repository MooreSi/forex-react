# Risk

**Living file — update when this domain teaches you something.**
Covers: `backend/src/services/risk/`.

## What it is

A deterministic, app-wide safety layer that decides whether a trade may be
placed and how large it may be — it never places or modifies orders itself,
and its **failure direction is refuse-to-trade**. It comprises the Tier-1
Risk Governor (risk-% sizing, hard per-trade $ ceiling, daily-loss halt,
loss-streak cooldown, R:R floor, directional cap, stop-width cap), the
per-day/per-window Trading Schedule that caps over-trading once a profit
target is hit (this is what implements the "£300 a day then stop" goal — see
`../../vision/000-goal.md`), a session gate, a circuit breaker on
consecutive losses, and the configuration surfaces (risk settings,
per-strategy parameters, Expert Tunables, custom strategies, retention).

## Where the code lives

- `services/risk/governor.py` — `is_trading_paused`, `check_pre_trade_filters`, `rg_size_and_check`, `rg_check_halt`, `rg_apply_halts_on_close`, `RR_BYPASS_SOURCES`
- `services/risk/schedule.py` — the 7×3 per-day/per-window profit-target gate with per-source keys
- `services/risk/risk_settings_repo.py` — risk settings with a 10s TTL cache, `get_effective_strategy`, `is_session_allowed`
- `services/risk/circuit_breaker_repo.py` — circuit-breaker state persisted in `vantage_risk_settings`
- `services/risk/strategy_params.py` — live-tunable per-strategy SL-shaping constants + named template library
- `services/risk/expert_params.py` — Tier-A behaviour constants (~135), defaults in code, overrides as JSON in `app_config`
- `services/risk/settings.py` — the settings surface six pages share
- `services/risk/app_config.py` / `app_config_repo.py` — the key/value store
- `services/risk/custom_strategies_repo.py` — user-defined strategies
- `services/risk/retention.py` — data-retention window and `switch_environment`
- `services/risk/repo.py` — remaining SQL (templates, realised-P&L sums)

## Constraints / must not change

- The domain gates trading, never places or modifies orders — failure direction is refuse-to-trade.
- **Manual orders are exempt by construction.** The schedule gate is wired in from `signals/resolution.py::resolve_open_trade_params`, reachable only from the automated `open_trade_from_signal` path. No special-casing anywhere else.
- Signal generation and Telegram ingestion are never affected by the schedule — it gates only the final automated "place an order" step.
- Gate ordering inside `resolve_open_trade_params`: session gate → Trading Schedule → `check_pre_trade_filters` → `rg_size_and_check`. Inside sizing: stop-width-vs-ATR cap first, then risk-% sizing; `rg_check_halt` applies daily loss limit and loss-streak cooldown.
- `expert_params.py` load-bearing properties (asserted by `tests/core/test_expert_params.py`): every default is **byte-identical** to the constant it replaced, and every value is **clamped** to a declared range — the clamp is a safety control ("a 0 in the R:R floor would open trades the system currently refuses"). Unknown keys are dropped, not stored.
- `settings.py::update` must not be bypassed: the repo write also forwards the change to the paired node and invalidates the TTL cache.
- `rg_apply_halts_on_close` stays wrapped in one outer `with db_module.db():` — a crash between its two config writes could leave a pause flag with no reason.
- `rg_check_halt` **must** be given the live MT5 balance, not the internal sim ledger — the sim ledger produced a false drawdown halt (confirmed 2026-07-07: $707 sim vs $1122 real).
- `strategy_params.py` scope is SL-shaping constants only — not TP-ladder close-% tables.

## Known things & gotchas

- **With SL Parsing off, a trade's realised risk is the template's `sl_pips` PLUS the distance from the fill to the far edge of the entry zone (2026-09-11, handover/032).** `keyword_triggers.apply_sl_parsing_override` anchors the derived stop to the far edge (BUY: `entry_low`, SELL: `entry_high`) deliberately, so the stop clears the whole zone whatever price the fill lands at and `validate_signal`'s direction checks pass. The cost is that risk per trade is not the template's number: measured over 261 live template trades in 14 days, the **median** realises exactly the template's distance (most fills land on the stop-adjacent edge, which is also the favourable one — 111 of 186), but 8% carry >=1.5x and one carried 2.4x ($120.30 against a template saying $70). With Fixed Lot Size nothing normalises it. **Do not read this as "losses exceed the stop"** — that is a different fault on a different path (reversal-engine/020); here the stop is honoured exactly and is simply wider than expected.
- **The drawdown watermark is account-scoped, and only the resolver enforces that (2026-09-10, bugs/042).** `peak_balance` lives in `app_config`, which `db/account_registry.py` copies as an install-wide table, so a second account inherited the first's watermark: 26004592 opened holding 25470480's $2,403.25 against a balance under $1,000, a 63% drawdown against a 40% limit. It did nothing only because the total-drawdown branch of `rg_check_halt` is reached solely from `rg_apply_halts_on_close`, which `close_trade` calls **only when `risk_governor_enabled`** — the daily-loss halt and give-back guard are called unconditionally, which is why those work with the governor off. Two consequences: the 40% limit is enforced on no close today, and switching the governor on would have halted trading on the first one. `resolve_db_path` now stamps `peak_balance_account` and clears the watermark when it does not match, so it re-anchors from the live balance on that account's next close. **The window this leaves:** between the clear and that close there is no watermark and the drawdown halt cannot fire — the same state a fresh install is in, and the safe direction, but it means the halt is only as old as the account's last close.
- **Out of Hours reads its window in `ooh_timezone`, not UTC, and has NO user interface again as of 2026-09-11 (handover/020).** It gained a card on 2026-09-07 and the owner removed it on 2026-09-11 (*"we already have a schedule which does the same thing"*) — which is not quite true: the schedule decides whether a trade is **opened**, this decides which strategy **manages one already open**. The removal is safe because `ooh_enabled` is 0 on the live install, not because the schedule covers it. Turning it on in the database starts a strategy no screen shows. `get_effective_strategy` is live — `monitor_cycle.py:206` picks the managing strategy with it — yet `ooh_enabled`, `ooh_start_time`, `ooh_end_time`, `ooh_strategy` and the holiday range are settable only by direct database edit. The timezone defaults to `""` (= UTC), byte-identical to the old behaviour, because a new default must retune nobody on upgrade AND because a machine-local default would make the Mac and the VPS start out disagreeing — the split the setting exists to prevent. An unusable zone falls back to UTC and warns; it must never raise, because this runs inside the monitor cycle. **Testing trap found here:** `get_effective_strategy` wraps its body in try/except and returns the base strategy on any error, which is indistinguishable from a correct UTC fallback — so bad-input tests routed through it pass even when the code raises. Assert on `_ooh_now` directly. Pinned by `tests/core/test_ooh_timezone.py`.
- **Per-source schedule toggles (2026-07-24):** each of the 7×3 windows independently gates Telegram / Reversal Engine / Breakout Engine, because Reversal Engine performs well overnight (Asia) but loses during London/NY — the opposite of the Telegram channels.
- **The daily profit target can be resumed past, for today only (2026-09-16, owner).** `trading_schedule_daily_target` refuses every automated entry for the rest of the day once the day's realised P&L clears it — and the header said "Circuit Breaker OK" throughout, the same false all-clear the news box was added to fix on 2026-09-04 but lasting hours instead of minutes. The badge now shows **Profit Target Reached** and clicking it opens the same Re-enable trading? dialog the breaker and the governor halt use. The resume is stored as a **day** (`trading_schedule_daily_target_resumed_day`, `YYYY-MM-DD` on the trading clock), not a flag, so it expires at midnight by construction — nothing clears it and nothing can leave it armed into tomorrow. It lifts the **daily** target only: the per-window targets, the window hours and the per-source toggles are separate gates and are untouched. It rides the existing schedule sync snapshot, and a snapshot with the key **absent** (a peer that predates the field) leaves it alone rather than clearing it, or every sync tick would re-arm a target the operator had deliberately resumed past. Badge state comes from `schedule.daily_profit_target_state()`, which reports `reached` only when the gate is actually holding orders — same contract as `news_pause_state`. Pinned by `tests/risk/test_daily_target_resume.py` and `tests/frontend/test_profit_target_badge.py`.
- Profit-per-window is computed **on demand** — `SUM(net_pnl)` of closed trades whose `open_time` falls in today's window — so it can't drift and needs no midnight reset.
- Two clocks in one domain: schedule times are local wall-clock HH:MM (matching the UI), while `is_session_allowed` maps sessions in **UTC** (Asia 21–07, London 07–12, overlap 12–16, NY 16–21).
- **`rr_filter_bypassed` has two arms and they are not interchangeable (2026-09-11, owner).** The static `RR_BYPASS_SOURCES` arm says "this channel supplies its own TP/SL levels"; the IME arm says "the user opted into taking this channel's fill the moment the signal lands". Only the second has a premise that staleness destroys, so `ignore_ime` (and `check_pre_trade_filters(ignore_ime_bypass=...)`) suspends **that arm alone**. Its only caller is the pending watcher's blind-gap re-validation — see `signals/gap_revalidation.py`. Worth knowing before touching either arm: IME is on globally on both the live and demo installs, so the IME arm currently bypasses the R:R floor for *every* Telegram channel with a `channel_parser_config` row, not just the two static ones.
- `RR_BYPASS_SOURCES` matching is case-insensitive and substring-based — the R:R floor is skipped entirely for paid-provider channels, including wrapped names like "Telegram Auto (Gold Diggers VIP)".
- `price_in_entry_range` is asymmetric on purpose: BUY zones are pullback areas, SELL zones are rally areas — the opposite side means chasing price.
- `is_session_allowed` imports `dpm.engine` *locally* to avoid a circular import — the session gate transitively depends on the DPM engine.
- Risk settings are served from a 10s TTL cache living on the `database` module itself; `update_risk_settings` carries a re-entrancy guard for sync-applied changes.
- `retention.switch_environment` is the genuinely dangerous call in that module: `db.init()` closes stale connections and flushes every registered cache, and the whole app then reads a different file.

## Open questions

- The Expert Tunables clamp ranges are "documented guesses, flagged for review" — the bounds themselves are unvalidated.

## Capability switches (2026-09-11)

Migration 41 added a column per new capability from
`docs/todo/reversal-engine/200`, every one defaulting to off, and
`risk/capability_gates.py` is the only place they are read. Two properties
are pinned by tests and are load-bearing:

- a DEFAULT settings row leaves every gate inert, including `sizing_inputs`,
  which returns inputs that multiply a lot size by exactly 1.0
- a settings row MISSING those columns behaves the same, so a client that
  has not run migration 41 trades exactly as it did

New modules: `sizing_policy.py` (volatility, drawdown and correlated-exposure
adjustments that MODIFY a base lot size rather than computing one --
`fees_sizing.suggest_lot_size` stays the single sizing rule),
`session_liquidity.py` (rollover, weekend reopen, period end -- illiquidity on
a clock, which no news filter can see) and `event_tiers.py` (per-tier windows
composed over `news_calendar`'s events, wider AFTER a release than before it).

**`sizing_policy` is not wired to the order path.** That is deliberate and it
needs a demo session; see `docs/todo/reversal-engine/210`.

## Saving the Risk card writes every field on it (2026-09-11)

`save_risk()` in `frontend/pages/settings/_risk.py` writes back all
thirteen of its fields from whatever the form currently shows, and the
form is built once from a single `get_risk_settings()` read at render
time. If that read is stale, ticking one checkbox and pressing Save
silently reverts every other setting on the card.

Observed once, on a live demo account: turning on
`min_fill_delay_enabled` set `htf_bias_gate_enabled` back to 0, a setting
the owner had turned on two days earlier and the only one with a measured
positive edge on the account. Restored within a minute. A fresh page load
renders the card correctly, so it does not reproduce on demand -- which is
what makes it dangerous rather than merely annoying.

The fix is for the handler to re-read at save time and write only what
actually changed. Until that lands, treat any Save on this card as a write
to all of it and check the rest afterwards.


## The trend gate points the wrong way in the Asian session (2026-09-12)

`governor.htf_bias_blocks` was measured over the whole clock. Split by
session it inverts, over all 5,414 `re_signals` rows:

| session | with the bias | against it |
|---|---|---|
| asian (00-07 UTC) | n=693, **-$6.26**, CI [-9.40, -3.12] | n=621, -$0.50, CI [-3.69, 2.69] |
| every other | n=1,480, -$1.02, CI [-3.30, 1.27] | n=1,154, **-$4.81**, CI [-7.48, -2.14] |

Both bolded cells hold their sign across chronological halves; neither of
the other two does anything but straddle zero. So outside Asia the gate
refuses the cohort that loses $4.81 a trade, and inside it the gate refuses
the cohort that loses nothing while admitting the one that loses $6.26 --
about $5.76 a trade across 1,314 signals.

`capability_gates.asian_bias_exempt` (migration 45,
`htf_bias_asian_exempt`, **off**) stands the rule down for that window. It
does NOT invert it: -$0.50 with an interval straddling zero is not an edge.

Three things about it are load-bearing:

- **It is read in `capability_gates`, not inside `htf_bias_blocks`.** Six
  order routes share that function and the measurement above is Reversal
  Engine data. Only the Reversal Engine's live path consults the exemption;
  pinned by `tests/risk/test_htf_bias_gate_asian_exemption.py`.
- **The Reversal Engine refuses a counter-bias trade in TWO places** --
  the gate, and the original `level_score < 0.75` bypass
  (reversal-engine/090) beside it. While the gate is on the second is a
  strict subset of the first and changes no outcome; exempt only the first
  and the second becomes load-bearing again, silently turning the switch
  into "counter-bias in Asia, but only on strong levels". Both stand down
  together. A source-shape assertion cannot see this -- it survived the
  first mutation pass -- so it is pinned behaviourally in
  `tests/reversal_engine/test_asian_bias_exemption_on_the_live_path.py`.
- **The exemption requires the trend gate to be on.** With the gate off
  the level-score bypass is the only rule there is, and it predates this
  change; exempting it would disable something nobody asked about.

Caveat on the numbers: almost all of that P&L is the engine's virtual
ledger. Only a minority of signals reach the broker, so this is the
population the engine simulates, not a realised curve.

**The Bounce engine holds the opposite rule for the same hours** --
`test_signal/test_signal_generate.py` blocks counter-bias signals in the
Asian session specifically. Open question for the owner, recorded in
`docs/simon-handover/033`.

## Volatility targeting points the wrong way on this book (2026-09-17)

Measured before wiring `sizing_policy` to the order path, which is why it was
not wired. 5,116 closed `re_signals` rows carrying the H1 ATR at signal time:

| ATR decile | avg P&L |
|---|---|
| 1 (3.13–5.34) | -$4.89 |
| 2 (5.34–6.10) | -$6.53 |
| 5 (7.12–7.74) | **-$8.26** |
| 9 (10.21–12.80) | -$3.37 |
| 10 (12.80–29.98) | **-$2.25** |

The policy's premise is that violent markets are where the damage is. Here the
violent decile is the least bad and the quiet-to-middle deciles are the worst,
so the scalar sizes down into the best cohort and up into the worst. Replaying
every trade: -$22,318 actual, **-$23,431** with targeting, against a flat
control at the same total exposure of -$22,428. **-$1,002 worse than a flat
size change**, which rules out "it just traded more".

The drawdown arm is not a dial here at all. Peak equity on `re_balance_log` is
$511.53, reached early; the curve is now -$22,299 and **99.2% of entries sit
more than 20% below that peak**. `dd_full_pct` is 0.20, so the scalar is
pinned at its `MIN_DD_SCALAR` floor of 0.25 permanently. That is a standing
75% size cut, not a response to conditions — and `max_lot_size` is the honest
place to express that if it is ever wanted.

Recorded in
`docs/simon-handover/040-volatility-sizing-would-have-lost-more-not-less.md`.
The switch stays on the Reversal Engine Tuning card, off, connected to
nothing.

**A real bug found in the inert code and fixed in the same pass.**
`sizing_policy.apply` had no upper lot ceiling while `MAX_VOL_SCALAR` is 1.5,
and 98% of this account's trades are sized at exactly the 0.10 `max_lot_size`
cap — so a quiet market would have returned **0.15 lots, over a cap the user
set**. `SizingInputs.max_lots` now carries it, `capability_gates.sizing_inputs`
supplies it OUTSIDE the `scale_on` branch (it is the account's ceiling, not the
capability's), and `tests/risk/test_sizing_policy_respects_the_lot_ceiling.py`
holds the negative control that shows the 0.15. Nothing caught this because
`apply` still has no callers: an unwired module gets no test pressure from its
call sites, so its own tests are all it has.
