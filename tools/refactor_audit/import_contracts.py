"""Named layering contracts for the backend/frontend split (M5).

M1-M4 enforced structure with anonymous counters. A counter tells you a
number moved; a contract tells you which principle broke and why it
mattered. This turns the five rules the refactor plan named into checks
that report themselves by name.

Two of them the refactor has already won outright, so they are enforced at
zero -- no baseline, no allowance, any violation fails. The other three
still have real violations, so they carry a recorded count that may only
shrink. That split is deliberate. A contract suite that goes red on the
day it lands gets switched off the week it lands, and a contract that is
green only because it was written to be green is worse than no contract:
it certifies a boundary nobody is holding.

Usage:
    python -m tools.refactor_audit.import_contracts --check
    python -m tools.refactor_audit.import_contracts --update-baseline
