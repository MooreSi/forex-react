"""Schema migrations 39 onward.

A continuation of `steps.py`, not a second registry. That file reached the
800-line structure ceiling at migration 38, and its first rule is that a
step is only ever APPENDED -- never renumbered, reordered or edited. A split
by number keeps that rule literally true: nothing moved except where the
text lives, and `steps.py` concatenates this onto the end so `MIGRATIONS`
still reads 1..N in order.

Same rules apply here. Append only, every statement idempotent.
