"""Settings tab — the domains behind one tab, and the money ones are named.

The two outbound connections (email, Telegram) live in `notifications.py`,
which also owns the test sends that prove them. They kept their
`/api/settings/...` paths; only the module moved.

Split into domain endpoints rather than one `PUT /settings`, for the reason the
frontend conventions give: `settings.py` reached 3,112 lines because everything
that needed a setting was added to one surface. A per-domain endpoint keeps the
React side honest too — one `*Tab.tsx` per domain, each reading its own shape.

**Risk and MT5 touch money.** Not by placing an order — nothing here does —
but by changing what the engines are allowed to do next time and which account
they do it on. Both echo back what was actually stored, so the operator sees
the value the engine will use rather than the one they typed.

Credentials are write-only through this layer: `GET /mt5` reports whether
credentials exist and for which login, never the password.
