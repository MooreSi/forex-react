"""The Signal Decision Log: what the app decided, and what four OFF gates would.

`docs/todo/signal-validation/010`. Recording only — **nothing here changes a
trade, and nothing here places one.** The switch that turns the recording on is
an ordinary parsing toggle (`tg_decision_log_enabled`, default OFF); this is
what it is for.

Its own router rather than three more handlers on `parsing.py`, for the same
reason it was its own module under NiceGUI: that surface is the parsing toggles
and the keyword editor, and this is neither.

**Two readouts, because they become useful at different times.** `summary` is
available from the first decision — how many signals each path executed and
declined, and what did the declining. `report` needs trades that have closed,
so it says nothing for days and is the reason the whole thing exists.

**Both are GET and neither polls.** This sits behind a live trading page; a
card that polled a database every few seconds to show a number that moves twice
a day is a cost with no benefit. The browser asks when the operator asks.

`mean_r` comes back as `null`, never `0.0`, for a variant that has scored
nothing. Zero expectancy and no evidence are different statements, and the
dashboard renders the difference.
