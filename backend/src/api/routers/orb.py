"""The London opening-range breakout report, and its one-press execution.

Classic ORB: the whole Asian session (00:00-08:00 UTC) is a confirmation
filter, the first fifteen minutes of London (08:00-08:15 UTC) is the traded
opening range, and a breakout only counts once price clears BOTH in the same
direction. Stop at the opening range's midpoint, target at twice the resulting
risk. A 3:1 level is shown alongside it and is informational only -- the
automated path closes fully at the target and manages no partial ladder.

Restored 2026-09-18. The NiceGUI Trading page had this card and the React port
dropped it, so the report, its chart, the Execute button, the lot size and the
unattended auto-execute were all unreachable.

**`/execute` places a real market order.** It is the only endpoint in this
module that does, it is a POST, and it goes through the node routing in
`services/cluster/remote_control.py` -- in Remote mode the order belongs on the
machine holding the account, not on the one being looked at.

The chart is rendered server-side and returned base64. The browser cannot build
it: it is matplotlib over the same candles the report was computed from, and a
second implementation in TypeScript would be a second chance to disagree with
the numbers printed beside it.
