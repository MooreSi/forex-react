"""Settings > Remote Node — this machine's role in the Local/Remote pair.

Exactly one role per machine: the VPS accepts the connection, the Mac initiates
it. Both use the same shared token, generated on the VPS. The protocol is in
`services/cluster/sync/`; this is the surface that configures it.

Ported on 2026-09-18. The NiceGUI page (`frontend/pages/remote_node.py`, 270
lines) was deleted in the big-bang replace and had no React replacement, which
left five things unreachable: starting and stopping the sync server, connecting
out to a VPS, headless mode, centralized signal generation, and the one-off
model-snapshot copy.

**Nothing here places an order**, and two things here change what the engines
do next:

  * **Centralized signal generation.** With it on and the VPS the active
    trader, the VPS stops analysing and parsing entirely and only executes what
    this machine forwards. If this machine goes offline the VPS does NOT fall
    back to generating its own signals — it alerts and waits. The response
    repeats that, because a switch whose consequence is "and then nothing
    trades" must not be a bare toggle.
  * **Headless mode** restarts the app.

The tokens are write-only through this layer, like every other credential: the
state says whether one is stored, never what it is.
