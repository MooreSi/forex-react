"""Set & Forget — the Alex G swing method, as a section of the Trading tab.

**No endpoint in this module places, closes or modifies anything.** That is the
design, not an accident of what has been built so far. The section's Execute
button posts to `api/routers/orders.py` — the same `/orders/market` and
`/orders/limit` the manual dialogs use — so there is exactly one order path in
this app and Set & Forget does not get a second one to drift from it.

Two reads, deliberately split the way `api/routers/ai.py` splits its own:

- `GET ""` is the measured evidence, the zones, the candidate the rules
  produce and the confluence score. No model is called and nothing is billed.
  Most of the time this is the whole answer, and a page that could only show it
  by billing an API call would make every glance billable.
- `POST /evaluate` adds the configured model's review on top. **Billable**, and
  the response says so. The model is only asked when there is a candidate to
  judge — see `services/setforget/analysis.evaluate`.

`value_per_lot` is the one piece of money arithmetic that crosses to the
browser, and it crosses as a per-lot figure the browser multiplies. It comes
from `fees_sizing.pnl`, this app's one P&L function: the position box has to
re-price as the operator moves the lot selector, and the alternative — a second
P&L implementation in TypeScript — is exactly the drift golden rule 5 forbids.
