"""Panel reads for the Breakout signal-generator page.

Every function here is one named operation the panel performs, dispatched off
the event loop. This module exists to kill `run_db(fn)` -- a controller hatch
that took an arbitrary callable from the page and ran it on the DB worker
thread. That inverted the layering: the *page* chose the data access and the
controller only supplied a thread. It also meant every panel imported this
engine's repo directly to have something to hand over.

The local/remote facade is built here rather than in the page. In Remote mode
(the VPS is the active trader) these transparently read the mirrored remote
signal-gen stats instead of this node's own local data -- see
`cluster/sync/remote_stats_facade.py`. The page cannot tell the difference,
which is the point.
