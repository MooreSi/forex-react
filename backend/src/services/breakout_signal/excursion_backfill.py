"""Reconstruct how far a closed breakout trade actually travelled.

The breakout engine has never measured excursion. `bo_signals` carried no
`mfe_pts`/`mae_pts` until 2026-09-16, so there has never been a reach
distribution for it and never an evidence base for its targets: `tp1_mult`
has sat at 1.0 since the engine was written, `rr_tp1` is 1.0 on every one of
its 122 closed signals, and at the realised payoff of 1.30 that needs a 43.5%
win rate against an actual 36.1%.

The Reversal Engine hit the same wall on 2026-09-11 and answered it the same
way (`reversal_engine/excursion_backfill.py`): the broker still holds the
tick history those trades walked through, so the data does not have to
accumulate forward for months. This is that mechanism for the other engine,
against the same `market/price_path` reconstruction, so the two engines'
numbers mean the same thing and can be compared.

**This writes one column pair and changes no decision.** It places nothing,
closes nothing, modifies no order, and never touches a row that already
carries an excursion.

Three filters, each keeping a different fiction out of the fit:

  * `live_exec_status='success'` -- a virtual signal's path is whatever the
    engine imagined, and pooling those with real fills produces a
    distribution describing a population that never traded. `'success'` is
    this engine's word for it; `'executed'` is the reversal engine's, and
    stating the reversal engine's here is what shipped a filter that matched
    nothing (docs/todo/bugs/062).
  * `status='closed'` -- an open trade's path is not finished.
  * `mfe_pts IS NULL` -- nothing already measured is overwritten.

Two honest limits, both worth stating before the numbers get used:

  * The reconstruction is capped at the trade's real `close_time`. What price
    did after an early exit is not part of that trade's path, and counting it
    would measure a trade nobody held.
  * It depends on the broker still retaining ticks that far back.
    `reversal_engine.excursion_backfill.probe_tick_history` answers that in
    one call and is not duplicated here -- a run that comes back mostly
    `no_coverage` should be read against it, because "the broker does not
    keep ticks that far back" and "the market was closed" produce the same
    zero.
