"""One place that reads the new capability switches.

Every capability from `docs/todo/reversal-engine/200` ships behind its own
column in `vantage_risk_settings` (migration 41) and every one of them is
OFF. This module turns those columns into the config objects the pure
modules take, so there is a single answer to "is this on" rather than one
per call site -- which is how a gate ends up enabled in one path and not
another, and how nobody can say afterwards what was running.

Two properties are load-bearing and both are pinned by tests:

  * **A default settings row leaves everything inert.** Not "mostly
    inert": `sizing_inputs` out of a default row returns a `SizingInputs`
    that multiplies a lot size by exactly 1.0.
  * **A settings row MISSING these columns behaves the same.** A client
    that has not run migration 41 must trade exactly as it did, rather
    than crashing or silently enabling something.

    (CI [-9.40, -3.12], both chronological halves negative) and trades
    against it 621 at -$0.50 (CI straddles zero), while everywhere else

    2026-09-12 over all 5,414 `re_signals` rows.

    shape as `vol_target_sizing_enabled`, which has said so on the card
    since 2026-09-11.

    Why the switch exists at all: spot XAUUSD on this broker publishes
    bid/ask and no Last, so there is no trade side to read and "volume"
    everywhere in this system is tick volume -- a count of quote changes,
    not size. `services/market/order_flow.py` labels every result with the
    method that produced it for that reason. GC futures are the lit venue
    where gold prints real size, and the only route by which any of this
    becomes a measurement instead of a proxy.

    Why it stops here, and it is NOT cost: the data this would use --
    daily GC volume and open interest -- is published free by CME. Only
    real-time streaming is a paid entitlement and this engine has no use
    for it. What is unanswered is whether futures flow predicts anything
    about THESE trades, which nothing in this repo has measured, so
    building the ingest first would be building on a guess. Recorded in
