"""Trading Schedule: a per-day, per-window profit-target discipline gate for
AUTOMATED order execution only.

Purpose: cap over-trading by blocking new automated entries once a
configurable profit target has been hit within a specific time-of-day
window, resuming at the start of the next window. Also blocks entries
entirely outside every enabled window for the current day. Signal
generation and Telegram ingestion are never affected -- this only gates
the final "place an order" step, and only on the automated path.

Wired in from core_signal_resolution.py's resolve_open_trade_params(), the
same place is_session_allowed() is checked -- that function is reachable
only from the automated open_trade_from_signal() path. core_manual_market_order.py
never calls resolve_open_trade_params(), so manual orders are exempt by
construction, with no special-casing needed here or in open_trade() itself.

Per-source toggles (2026-07-24): each of the 7x4 windows also independently
gates Telegram / Reversal Engine / Breakout Engine (SOURCE_KEYS) -- see
check_trading_schedule()'s `source` parameter. Reversal Engine performs well
overnight (Asia) but loses during London/NY, the opposite of the Telegram
channels, so a single blanket automated-order switch isn't enough; each
engine's own live-execution path (reversal_engine_live_execute.py,
breakout_signal_live_execute.py) now calls this with its own source key,
alongside the four pre-existing Telegram call sites.

Per-window strategy/EA-template override (2026-08-01): each window also
carries an optional `strategy_override` -- a STRATEGY_* key or a
"template:<name>" override string, same shape as
core_db_channel.get_channel_strategy_override()'s return value. When the
schedule is enabled and the current time falls inside a window with this
set, get_schedule_strategy_override() returns it and
core_signal_resolution.resolve_open_trade_params() substitutes it in place
of that signal's normal per-channel override -- so a window can force
Reversal Engine and/or Breakout Engine (whichever are ticked) onto one
strategy/template regardless of what's picked per-channel on the Trading
page, for as long as that window is active. A 4th window per day was added
alongside this (BLOCKS_PER_DAY 3 -> 4).

Per-channel Telegram toggle+override (2026-08-03): the single "telegram"
switch above was too coarse for anyone running multiple Telegram channels
with different personalities (e.g. one scalps London, one only performs
overnight) -- each window now carries `telegram_channels`, a
{channel_name: {"enabled", "strategy_override"}} map keyed by the same
canonical channel name core_db_channel.get_channel_strategy_override() uses,
so channel A can run Strategy X and channel B can run Strategy Y within the
same window. A channel never explicitly added to a window's map (including
every channel, for a schedule saved before this feature existed) falls back
to that window's `telegram_default_enabled` bool with no override -- see
_migrate_telegram_field()'s docstring for the exact migration from the old
flat "telegram" bool. Reversal Engine/Breakout Engine are unaffected --
neither has a live Telegram identity to split by, so they keep the single
window-level strategy_override above.

Storage: app_config keys "trading_schedule_enabled" (plain "1"/"0") and
"trading_schedule" (JSON), same pattern as trading.py's hidden_strategies.

Profit-per-window is computed on demand -- SUM(net_pnl) of closed trades
whose open_time falls within today's window -- rather than maintaining a
separate running counter, so it can't drift out of sync with the real
trade history and needs no reset-at-midnight bookkeeping.

## Which clock

Windows and the daily target are read on the **trading clock**: the user's own
local time, wherever they are, daylight saving included (owner decision,
docs/simon-handover/017 and 020 -- "it should always be local time").

By default that is the machine's own clock, which is the user's clock on the
user's machine. A machine that is NOT where its user is -- a VPS -- can be
given an explicit offset instead, because this schedule is mirrored between the
Mac and the VPS: the setting travels and the clock does not, so a 09:00 window
set in the UK would otherwise gate a different part of the trading day on a
server abroad, with nothing reporting the difference.

Note this is a different clock from the SESSIONS (Asia/London/NY, the news and
counter-bias windows), which are UTC. That is deliberate -- sessions are a fact
about the market, these windows are a fact about the operator's day -- and now
written down rather than being an accident.
