"""The Telegram message scan pipeline (M4 B9a).

This was SimulationEngine._scan_messages: 314 lines of dedup, logic
keywords, instant entry, SL adjustment, parse, staleness, strategy
resolution, execution and alerting, sitting inline on the runtime where
the only way to run it was to construct an engine. The body below is that
code verbatim -- every branch, comment and log line -- with one mechanical
change: the fifteen `self.X` references became fields on ScanCtx.

Same idiom as the runtime's _make_close_trade_ctx: one authoritative
binding site instead of collaborators reached for ad hoc from inside a
god object. A relocation like this fails by dropping a collaborator on a
branch nobody exercises, so the binding is asserted directly in
tests/core/test_scan_messages_relocation.py rather than left to luck.

One field earns an explanation. `engine_for_eval` is the engine itself,
threaded through to channel_strategy_ai.evaluate_signal_strategy, which
still takes an engine-shaped object. Naming it rather than hiding it
behind `self` is the point: it is the one piece of engine coupling this
pipeline has left, and it is now visible in a dataclass instead of
invisible in a method body.
