"""EA-native trade-management templates (2026-07-23) -- Trading > Strategy
Parameters > Templates section.

A template is a complete, self-contained, EA-managed trade-management
definition (Grid vs Single entry, TP/SL visibility, trailing method,
breakeven rule, cancel-pending-siblings, profit harvesting) that a channel
can be assigned to in place of a built-in strategy -- see
core_signal_resolution.py's handling of a "template:<name>" channel
override. Every field is sent fresh to the EA on each open_trade/
place_pending_order call (ea_bridge.py's `template` payload), so changing
a template's values never needs an EA recompile.

Modelled on core_strategy_params.py's conventions (get/set/cache shape),
but this is a genuinely different concept -- that module holds named
presets of ONE existing Python strategy's numeric knobs; this module holds
complete alternative management definitions that bypass Python strategy
dispatch entirely once assigned to a channel.

# smaller one; 0 = breakeven; positive = a locked-in profit) -- unlike
# be_trigger/trail_mode="tp", the SL target here is independent of the

# rather than only ever locking the exact price that armed it. The last
# rung can also strip the take-profit (remove_tp) so the position rides
# the trailing stop instead of being flattened at a fixed target. Once

# since the anchor now always fires at market regardless of the zone
# (2026-08-03 always-fire directive), price has frequently already run past

    One definition, because two call sites ask it -- scan_messages.py, which
    decides whether the format-triggered Limit Runner strategy wins, and
    scan_auto_execute.py, which decides whether to stage grid legs. They must
    give the same answer for the same channel; core_instant_followup.py's own
    VPS-forwarding twin is what drifting copies of one question look like.

    Anything that is not a template override is not a grid template, and a
    template that cannot be read is treated as not-grid: the caller's
    fallback is the resting order, which is the safer of the two for a message
    that literally says LIMITS.

    TP4's 100% can only take the 25% its own earlier levels left behind.

    And close_full_on_last means the deepest CONFIGURED level banks whatever is
    still open regardless of its own %, so a ladder whose %s stop at 70 is not
    leaving 30% running unless that switch is off.

    total_r is the all-levels-hit figure, deliberately NOT probability-weighted:
