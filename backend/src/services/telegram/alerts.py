    the row can't support an honest figure. Final-close only -- deliberately
    not used by fmt_mt5_partial_close, where "total" isn't known yet.

    Pips are derived from realised MONEY, not from (exit - entry). That
    difference is load-bearing: a laddered trade banks most of its move in
    partial closes at prices the final exit never returns to, so the raw
    price move understates -- or inverts -- what was actually achieved.
    Confirmed on a live SELL that closed its last portion at exactly its
    entry (0 pips by price) having already realised +$43.29 through
    partials. Money already sums every partial and, for an EA Template
    grid, every leg.

    initial_risk is the preferred denominator because core_profit_sync
    recomputes it per FILLED leg (see its own comment) -- so it stays
    correct for a multi-leg grid whose row-level lot_size is only the
    promoting leg's, where profit / (lot_size * CONTRACT_SIZE) would
    overstate the move by roughly the leg count. Pips are then expressed in
    that same risk unit, which keeps the two numbers mutually consistent:
    R x risk_pips == total_pips, always.
