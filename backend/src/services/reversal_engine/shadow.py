"""Champion and challenger: what the other configuration would have done.

Section 5.7 of `docs/todo/reversal-engine/200`. Today a model or a template
goes live and the evidence arrives afterwards: v9 shipped on a Saturday and
had its worst Asian session on the next trading day, with nothing to
compare it against.

A shadow decision is derived from facts the live path has **already
computed** -- the ML probability it scored, whether the entry trigger
confirmed, whether a liquidity window was open. Not by re-running the gates
against a second market read. Two reasons, and both matter: a second read
is a different moment and would answer a different question, and a shadow
that makes its own bridge calls costs latency on the live path it exists to
shadow.

Recording never raises. This sits on the order path, and a measurement must
never cost a trade its execution.
