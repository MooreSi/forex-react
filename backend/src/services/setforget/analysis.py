"""The orchestrator: evidence in, a candidate trade out, then a model's review.

Three properties hold this together, and all three are about refusing.

**The deterministic candidate is the floor, not the ceiling.** It is built from
the rules before any model is asked anything. That keeps the page useful and
honest with no API key configured, keeps the measured evidence free to look at,
and -- the reason it matters most -- means there is always something to check
the model's answer against.

**A model's numbers are re-validated, never adopted.** An LLM asked for a stop
and a target produces a stop and a target every single time, including for a
chart with nothing on it. Everything that comes back goes through
`setup.build` and `setup.invalidations`; what fails is discarded, the rules'
levels stand, and the page is told which rule it broke.

**Nothing here places anything.** `evaluate` returns a proposal. The browser
hands it to the existing money endpoints in `api/routers/orders.py` once the
operator has read it and pressed a button.
