"""Market structure: swing points, the bias they spell, and the last impulse.

The bottom of the Set & Forget stack. Areas of interest are built from swing
points, the confluence checklist scores against the bias, and the Fibonacci
band is measured over the impulse -- so everything above this file inherits
whatever this file gets wrong, silently.

Two decisions are load-bearing and neither is arbitrary:

**A swing is confirmed or it does not exist.** The highest bar of a rising
series is the last one, and it is not a swing high -- nothing has turned back
down from it yet. Counting it would let a trade be taken against "structure"
that is really just the right-hand edge of the chart, which is the single most
common way a top-down read talks itself into a top.

**Ties resolve to the earlier bar.** Real candles rarely tie, but a bar that
tops out and the bar that opens at its close often share a high to the tick,
and gold quotes to two decimals. Without a rule, one series gives two swings
where a trader sees one. The rule: strictly higher than everything before it
in the window, at least as high as everything after.
