"""A candidate Set & Forget trade: its ratio, its refusals, and its cash.

The last gate before a setup reaches a button that can place it, so most of
this file is refusals. A setup that is merely wrong -- stop on the far side of
entry, target behind price, 1:0.8 written up as a plan -- renders as a tidy
card with plausible numbers and nothing on screen says no. `invalidations` is
what says no, and the page shows what it said.

**No money maths is done here.** `money_at_risk`, `money_at_target` and
`lot_from_risk` forward to `trading/fees_sizing`, which is this app's one P&L
function and its one sizing function. Golden rule 5 -- a second implementation
would be a second answer to "what is this trade worth", and the two would drift
without either looking wrong.
