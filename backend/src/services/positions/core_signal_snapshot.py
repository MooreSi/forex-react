"""Capture what the market looked like the moment a reference-channel
signal arrived (2026-08-04).

WHY
---
We copy Gold Diggers VIP and GOLD DIGGERS INSTITUTIONAL without knowing
what they are reading. Their chart screenshots show FVG/iFVG, and their
messages show a two-stage pattern (VIP fires a bare market call, then sends
the zone and levels ~40s later) -- but "why this level, why now, why market
rather than limit" is currently guesswork.

So: log the evidence. One row per signal EVENT with the full indicator
picture across M1/M5/M15, and let a week of real data answer it, rather
than reasoning from two screenshots.

DESIGN NOTES
------------
Poll-driven rather than hooked into the parser. There are seven separate
INSERT sites for vantage_tg_signals across the scan/instant-entry/backfill
paths; hooking each would be invasive, easy to miss one, and risks breaking
signal processing for a research feature. Polling for un-snapshotted rows
catches every path including ones added later, and cannot break trading.

The cost is a few seconds of capture lag. That is recorded explicitly
(capture_lag_s) rather than hidden, and it barely matters for the
candle-derived indicators, which only change on bar close. It DOES matter
for bid/ask, so those are labelled as at-capture, not at-signal.

Nothing here is on the trading path and every failure is swallowed: a
research log must never be able to stop a trade.

WHERE THE ROWS GO (changed 2026-08-06)
--------------------------------------
Into reversal_engine.db via pro_corpus.py, not the core database. The core
db is per-environment, so the original design quietly split this corpus in
two the moment the app switched between demo and live. See pro_corpus.py.

    (see capture_background_snapshot for why the study is unusable without

    failure-isolated 5s tick to sit on does not need a second one.
