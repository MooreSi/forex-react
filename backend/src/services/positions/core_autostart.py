"""Auto-restart watchdog — OS-level supervision so the app comes back on its own.

Before this existed, nothing restarted the app once it stopped. A stop on
2026-08-14 19:09 (a clean shutdown for a code update) left it down for roughly
47 hours -- there is no forex_trader.log.2026-08-15 at all -- until someone
logged in remotely and started it by hand. A crash or a VPS reboot would have
looked exactly the same.

Design: the OS scheduler does NOT launch run.py directly. It launches
tools/watchdog.py every couple of minutes, and *that* decides whether to start
the app. Supervising through a poller instead of through the scheduler's own
keep-alive is deliberate:

  * launchd's KeepAlive restarts on process exit, so it cannot tell a crash
    from `FOREX Stop.command` (a SIGTERM, which is a non-zero exit) or from
    the app's own restart_app() flow. Stop would not stop, and the in-app
    restart would race launchd's relaunch -- with run.py's _claim_port()
    killing whichever instance bound second, potentially in a loop.
  * A poller has no exit-code semantics to get wrong. It asks one question --
    "is something serving on the app's port?" -- and acts only on the answer.

Intent is carried by a sentinel file (the "armed" flag) rather than by whether
the scheduler entry exists, which is what lets Stop mean stop: the stop scripts
disarm, the app re-arms on startup when the toggle is on. Disarmed, the
scheduler entry stays installed but every tick is a no-op.
