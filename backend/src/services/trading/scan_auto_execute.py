"""Auto-execution flow -- extracted verbatim (no logic changes) from
core/engine.py's SimulationEngine._scan_messages (lines 6984-7364), as
part of the core/engine.py migration series. See
docs/todo/refactor/core-scan-messages-auto-execute-migration/020-*.md.

Highest real-money surface in the whole migration series: places a real
MT5 order via `open_trade` (already extracted -- reused, not re-derived)
and, for Conservative/Scalp Runner, follows up with a `modify_order`
SL/TP sync and an EA `update_trade` call on a live ticket.

`get_open_trades_fn`/`find_and_apply_instant_followup_fn`/
`check_pre_trade_filters_fn`/`suggest_lot_size_fn`/`get_trading_balance_fn`
are required explicit collaborators bound to the same simplified call
shapes `_scan_messages` itself uses -- small/already-extracted helpers out
of scope for this pack (see the parent
`core-scan-messages-migration/README.md`). `open_trade_fn` defaults to the
real, already-extracted `core_open_trade.open_trade`.

The instant-followup-matched early return carries a `followup_matched: True`
key (added at core-engine-wiring time, not part of the original verbatim
extraction) -- the original inline code did `continue` immediately in this
branch, skipping the "signal detected" Telegram alert `_scan_messages` sends
for every other outcome (the followup path already sends its own, more
specific notification via `find_and_apply_instant_followup_fn`). Without
this flag, a caller delegating straight to this function would have no way
to tell "instant followup matched, skip the alert" apart from "trade opened
normally, send the alert" -- both return `executed: True` -- and would
introduce a duplicate/misleading Telegram alert on every IME-followup match.
