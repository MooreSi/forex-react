"""Instant Market Entry (IME) opening flow -- extracted verbatim (no logic
changes) from core/engine.py's SimulationEngine._process_instant_entry, as
part of the core/engine.py migration series. See
docs/todo/refactor/core-instant-entry-migration/020-*.md.

Calls core_open_trade.open_trade (pack 11) -- a real MT5 market-order
placement, unchanged from the original. This module places no order
itself; it only calls whatever `bridge` its caller supplies, via
open_trade.

Reuses core_close_trade.get_trading_balance (pack 10) and
core_trade_reporting.get_open_trades (already extracted). dpm_engine is an
already-extracted, stable, pure module for ATR computation -- called
through exactly as the original did.
