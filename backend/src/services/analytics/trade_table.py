"""Closed trades, deal by deal, as the Analysis table shows them.

Built from **MT5's own deal history**, not the local ledger. A trade opened by
hand in the terminal, or by the copier EA, never had a local row, and a table
built from the local ledger would silently omit it while looking complete.

The local database is still where the attribution comes from: which channel a
ticket came from, which strategy ran it, how far the TP ladder actually
reached, its R:R, whether it was a resting order and how long it sat, and which
EA-template group its legs belong to. `ticket_maps` builds those, and this
merges them onto the deals.

**A position is many deals.** One entry deal and one or more exits, which is
what a partial close looks like from the broker's side, so the lots column
shows the breakdown. A position with no entry deal in the window is still
reported -- it was opened before the window started, and dropping it would make
a long-running trade disappear from the day it closed.

`comment_attribution_maps` fills the gaps: positions with no local row of their
own are attributed from the comment the opening order carried, with
`setdefault` so a real local row always wins over an inference.

Nothing here places, closes or modifies anything. It is the read behind one
table.
