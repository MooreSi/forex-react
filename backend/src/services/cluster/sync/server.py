"""
Sync server — runs on the VPS (the fixed-IP, always-on side).

Accepts exactly one trusted peer (the Mac) authenticated by a shared token.
Owns the authoritative copy of settings; the Mac's changes arrive as
proposals and are applied here via the existing core.database functions,
then the confirmed state is pushed back to every connected peer.

Also implements the STAND_DOWN / RESUME handshake that makes the Local/Remote
toggle safe: STAND_DOWN stops this node's own trading engines (recording
which ones it stopped, so RESUME only restarts what sync itself paused —
never overriding a preference the VPS's own operator set deliberately) and
replies with a summary of currently-open positions.
