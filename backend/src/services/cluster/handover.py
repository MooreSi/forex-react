"""Handing trading control between this node and the paired one.

**Exactly one node may execute new trades.** Both sides are pointed at the same
MT5 account, so two active nodes is two engines opening positions against one
balance — the failure this whole cluster protocol exists to prevent.

The sequence lived in the NiceGUI header's `_toggle_mode` until 2026-09-18 and
is moved here unchanged. It is moved rather than rewritten deliberately: the
ordering IS the safety property, and each half is ordered so that a failure
leaves the account with **no** active trader rather than two.

  * **Taking over** (remote -> local): ask the peer to stand down and wait for
    its acknowledgement FIRST. Only once it has acknowledged is this node
    marked active and its engines started. A peer that does not answer leaves
    this node exactly as it was — view-only — because the alternative is this
    node trading while the VPS believes it still owns the account.

  * **Handing back** (local -> remote): stop this node's engines FIRST, then
    ask the peer to resume. If the peer does not acknowledge, the engines stay
    stopped and this node is still marked `remote_vps`. Nothing is trading,
    which is a state the operator can see and retry from.

`active_trader` gates only NEW entries. Positions this node already has open
keep being managed by its own monitor loop through a handover — trailing, SL
and TP all continue — so handing back does not abandon them. That is why the
result says how many are still running: the operator deserves to know that
"view-only" does not mean "flat".

Nothing here closes a position. The engines' `start`/`stop` are the same calls
the mode toggle has always made.
