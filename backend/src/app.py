App lifecycle — engine/bridge/Telegram/sync startup and shutdown.

Extracted out of frontend/app.py so this logic can be called from two
different entry points: the normal NiceGUI-hosted app (ui/app.py's
@app.on_startup/@app.on_shutdown wrap the functions below) and the headless
entry point (run_headless.py), which never imports NiceGUI at all. Keeping
exactly one implementation here means a fix or a new sub-engine wired in here
automatically applies to both modes — nothing to remember to port twice.

Nothing in this module references nicegui.
