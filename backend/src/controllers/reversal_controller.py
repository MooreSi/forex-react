"""The Reversal Engine's own panel: its P&L, its ML gate, its virtual trades.

Split out of `engines_controller` on 2026-09-19. That file runs the engine
LIFECYCLE — which engines exist, starting and stopping them, and routing a
control to whichever node is actually trading — and had grown a second job:
everything the Reversal Engine specifically measures about itself. Adding the
virtual trade history took it past the 200-line controller ceiling, and the
gate's message is the right diagnosis: a controller that long is holding more
than one thing.

Nothing moved but its address. Every operation here is the same forwarder it
was, in the same order, with the same comments.
