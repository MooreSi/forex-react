"""Set & Forget section's API.

Forwards, and nothing else. The reading of the chart, the rules that build a
candidate and the re-validation of whatever the model sends back all live in
`services/setforget/`; this file names the three operations the section can
perform and hands each to one service.

**Nothing here places an order.** The section's Execute button posts to the
existing money endpoints in `api/routers/orders.py` -- the same two the manual
Market order and Limit order dialogs use -- so no second order path exists to
drift from the first.
