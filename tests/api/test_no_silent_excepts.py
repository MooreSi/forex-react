"""Silent-except ratchet for the HTTP layer (was the frontend; stage2 phase4/030).

`except Exception: pass` in a live-money app swallows failures, leaving
stale-but-plausible numbers on screen with no log and no indicator. The count
REGRESSED 31 → 44 between the 2026-08-08 and 2026-08-11 reviews; this gate
stopped the climb and drove it to zero.

**Retargeted 2026-09-18** from `frontend/` to `backend/src/api/`. The NiceGUI
frontend was replaced by React, so `frontend/` holds no Python at all — and a
scan over a directory with no `.py` in it reports zero offenders every run
while protecting nothing. That is the `delegation_checker.py` failure this repo
was rebuilt after, so the rule moved with the layer rather than staying put and
going quietly green. `test_the_scan_has_something_to_scan` fails closed if the
new directory ever empties too.

Nothing here can reach a broker.

# The remaining 38 were converted in one pass: every one is now

# At zero this stops being a ratchet and becomes a rule: the frontend does not
# silently swallow exceptions. Which is the point — a live-money dashboard
# showing stale-but-plausible numbers with no log and no indicator is the
# failure mode this gate was created for.
