"""Profit factor and expectancy for the Breakout engine.

The NiceGUI app had an Edge tab -- `ui/pages/edge_dashboard.py` -- whose whole
job was the numbers that decide whether an engine has an edge at all: profit
factor, expectancy, win rate, and average win against average loss. It is the
one page the React port has no counterpart for.

A win rate on its own decides nothing. 38% with an average win three times the
average loss is a profitable engine; 60% with the ratio inverted is not. These
two figures are what separate those cases, and neither exists anywhere in the
app today.

Computed in SQL over the engine's own closed rows rather than in the browser:
gross profit and gross loss are two sums the database can do in one pass, and
a browser deriving them from a paginated list would be deriving them from a
page.

Its own module because `breakout_signal_repo.py` sits at the 800-line ceiling
and this asks a different question: that file records what the engine DID,
this asks whether any of it amounts to an edge.
