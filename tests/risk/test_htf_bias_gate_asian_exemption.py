"""The trend gate is wrong in the Asian session, and may be stood down there.

**Nothing in this file reaches a broker.** Every test calls pure functions
with dicts, or reads source text; no bridge is constructed and no order
call exists to reach.

## What was measured

`governor.htf_bias_blocks` exists because trading WITH the higher-timeframe
bias was the only profitable group on the account -- see
`test_htf_bias_gate.py` for that evidence and the 2026-09-08 post-mortem
behind it. That measurement was taken over the whole clock. Split by
session, it inverts:

| session | with the bias | against it |
|---|---|---|
| asian (00-07 UTC) | n=693, **-$6.26**, CI [-9.40, -3.12] | n=621, -$0.50, CI [-3.69, 2.69] |
| every other | n=1,480, -$1.02, CI [-3.30, 1.27] | n=1,154, **-$4.81**, CI [-7.48, -2.14] |

Measured 2026-09-12 over all 5,414 `re_signals` rows. Both bolded cells hold
their sign across chronological halves (-6.58/-5.94 and -5.37/-4.25);
neither of the other two does anything but straddle zero.

Outside Asia the gate refuses the cohort that loses $4.81 a trade, which is
what it is for. Inside Asia it refuses the cohort that loses nothing and
admits the one that loses $6.26 -- about $5.76 a trade across 1,314 signals,
pointing the wrong way.

**This exempts; it does not invert.** Asian counter-trend is -$0.50 with an
interval straddling zero. That is "no evidence of an edge", not an edge, and
a rule that went on to PREFER counter-trend trades in Asia would be reading
a straddling interval as a signal -- the exact mistake the AI tuner declined
to make on 2026-09-11.

## Why it is a capability gate and not an argument to `htf_bias_blocks`

Two reasons, and the second is the one that decided it.

1. `htf_bias_blocks` is shared by six order routes and the evidence above is
   Reversal Engine signals only. A switch read inside it is a switch that
   silently reaches five routes whose Asian numbers nobody has looked at.

2. **The Reversal Engine's live path refuses a counter-bias trade in TWO
   places**, not one: the shared gate, and the original `level_score < 0.75`
   bypass beside it (reversal-engine/090). While the gate is on the second
   is a strict subset of the first, so today it changes no outcome -- but
   stand the first one down in Asia and the second takes over, and the
   switch would quietly apply to high-scoring levels only. Both have to
   stand down together, which means the exemption is a decision made at that
   call site, above both rules.

So `capability_gates.asian_bias_exempt` answers "does this session opt out
of the trend rule at all", `governor.htf_bias_blocks` keeps its signature
and all six callers, and the two other engines are untouched.

**An open question for the owner.** The Bounce engine holds the OPPOSITE
belief: `test_signal/test_signal_generate.py` blocks counter-bias signals in
the Asian session specifically, and has since before this was measured. Two
engines with opposite rules about the same hours is a thing to settle, not
to leave implicit. Recorded in docs/simon-handover/.

**Default OFF** (rules/60-adding-a-tunable): with the column absent or 0,
every one of these paths behaves exactly as it does today, and this has
never been demoed.
