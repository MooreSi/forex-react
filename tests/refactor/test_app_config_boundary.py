"""The top layer reads and writes app config through a controller.

`backend.src.config` was the single largest remaining coupling in
`frontend-reaches-the-backend-through-controllers`: eight of the fifteen
frontend source units imported it directly, which is more than the whole gap
between the count and its baseline.

CLAUDE.md flags this module by name -- *"backend.src.config imports from
frontend COUNT against the controller-boundary contract"* -- and the frontend
only ever needed four things from it: read the whole config, read one key,
write some keys, and ask whether debug mode is on. Those are now
`settings_controller` functions.

The pairing matters as much as the boundary. `save_config` writing somewhere
`load_config` does not read would lose a user's settings silently, so that
round trip is asserted rather than assumed.
