"""The frontend gets its strategy vocabulary through a controller.

`frontend-reaches-the-backend-through-controllers` counts distinct
(source unit -> imported module) edges, and five frontend units were reaching
straight into `backend.src.utils.models` for strategy ids and display names:
the trading, history and chart packages, plus ai_summary and backtest.

Constants are not a service, so none of them risks calling into a service on
the UI thread -- but the contract counts them, and the architecture's answer to
"where does the frontend get things from" is the same either way: a controller.
Re-exporting here also means a renamed strategy id has one place to change
rather than thirteen import sites.

These assert the boundary AND that the re-export cannot drift from its source,
which is the failure mode a re-export introduces.
