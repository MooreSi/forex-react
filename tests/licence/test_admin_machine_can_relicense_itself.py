"""The machine that issues licences must be able to issue one to itself.

Hit for real on 2026-09-02. The owner's Mac lost its licence file, restarted,
and could not get back in:

    10:09:52  No valid licence found — showing activation screen.
    10:09:53  [RemoteClient] Agent started (connecting to 217.155.25.160:8443)
    10:10:01  Connection error: ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 61]

A deadlock, and a complete one:

  1. no licence, so `guard.enforce()` shows the activation screen and startup
     stops there -- `run.py` calls it BEFORE `backend.src.app.startup()`;
  2. the screen starts the remote CLIENT so an admin can push a licence down;
  3. the client dials the admin server;
  4. **the admin server is this same machine**, and it is started from
     `startup()`, which step 1 never reached;
  5. connection refused, for ever.

`ADMIN_AVAILABLE` and `password_is_set()` were both true the whole time. The
issuer simply never ran, because the issuer will not start until it is
licensed.

So the activation screen starts the admin server too, when this machine is
the admin machine. The console can then issue a licence to itself and the
existing self-heal push does the rest.

The guard's own rule is untouched: this does not grant, weaken or bypass a
licence. It starts the thing that can legitimately issue one.
