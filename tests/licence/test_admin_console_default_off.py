"""The KeyGen admin console must not appear on somebody else's client machine.

`_find_admin_open_fn()` decided the admin button on one fact: is there a
`KeyGen/forex_admin.py` next to the app or in `~/Documents`? Its own comment
says "Remote users don't have that directory" -- an assumption that stops being
true the moment `~/Documents` is synced (iCloud Drive) or the folder is copied
along with the app. Confirmed live 2026-09-06: a remote Mac on the LAN showed
the admin button while the console listed it as an ordinary client, so the
console's own "Remove Admin" could not take the button away -- it was never a
grant in the first place.

The grant is now the only route on a client machine. A machine that another
machine's admin server has welcomed as a client writes
`remote/is_remote_client` (see `remote/client.py`), and while that marker is
there the KeyGen path is refused no matter what is on disk;
`_find_remote_admin_open_fn()`'s explicit grant still works, which is what the
console's Grant Admin button is for.

The marker is deliberately NOT written on a machine that has its own admin
password -- the activation screen makes the admin Mac dial its own server
(`config/licence/guard.py`), and that welcome must not lock the owner out of
their own console.
