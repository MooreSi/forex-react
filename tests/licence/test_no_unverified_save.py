"""No path in this app stores a licence it has not verified.

`enforce()` is fully covered by behaviour tests (`test_guard_enforce.py`,
`test_licence_recovery.py`) and they are the right instrument for what it
decides. This file pins something they cannot: that no FUTURE path writes a
licence to disk without checking its signature first.

That matters because the app's rules forbid adding a licence or auth bypass
"even for testing", and the shape such a bypass would take is not a deleted
check -- it is a NEW save site that simply never had one. A behaviour test
covers the paths that exist; this covers the ones that do not exist yet.

There are three save sites today, in two files:

    guard.py::enforce               fingerprint drift -- re-verifies against
                                    the ORIGINAL machine id before updating
    guard.py::_activate             manual activation from the licence screen
    remote/client.py MSG_LICENCE    a key pushed by the admin console

Each is guarded, in one of the two shapes a guard can take: a negative check
that returns early, or a positive check whose body contains the save.

Structural, so it costs nothing and cannot be satisfied by a mock.
