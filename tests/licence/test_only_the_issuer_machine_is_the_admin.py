"""Only the machine that issues licences may be the admin server.

Reported live 2026-09-12. A client MacBook came back from a restart running the
admin SERVER instead of the client: `app.startup()` is
`if _should_start_remote_server(): ... elif _remote_client_enabled(config): ...`,
so the promotion also stopped it dialling home, and the owner's console showed
it permanently offline while it sat on the LAN listening on 8443 with its own
`remote/tls.py`-shaped certificate.

`_should_start_remote_server()` was `LOCAL_ADMIN_AVAILABLE and
password_is_set()` -- two filesystem facts, both true on that machine by
accident: `~/Documents/KeyGen/forex_admin.py` arrives on every Mac signed into
the owner's Apple ID (`~/Documents` is inside the iCloud Drive container), and
a stale `remote/admin_password.hash` was left over from an earlier session.

The 2026-09-06 `is_remote_client` marker does not cover this. That marker is
written on MSG_WELCOME -- by the client loop the promotion prevents from
running -- so a machine promoted before its first welcome can never write it,
and one whose marker is missing for any other reason promotes again.

The issuer is therefore pinned to hardware. It adds no fragility that licensing
does not already carry: `get_fingerprint()` is what the licence itself is keyed
to, so a machine whose fingerprint drifts has lost its licence either way.
