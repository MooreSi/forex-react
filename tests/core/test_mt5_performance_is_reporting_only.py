"""`compute_mt5_performance` is a REPORTING call. Nothing may decide a trade on it.

Measured 2026-09-10 with the page open: `/history?days=90` ran **31.5 times a
minute**, the largest single source of bridge traffic left after the History
panels were coalesced. It is not the History panels — it is this function,
called independently by the AI Summary page, the History page, the Trading
page, the Telegram `!report` command and the email scheduler, each on its own
refresh.

Every one of those composes something a human reads. **None of them decides a
trade**, and this file exists to keep it that way.

**Why it is pinned.** A cache was attempted here on 2026-09-10 to collapse that
31.5/min, on exactly this reasoning. It was reverted: a module-level cache
keyed only by `days` is shared across bridges, and eight existing tests caught
the interference immediately. The reasoning was sound and the implementation
was not.

If it is attempted again it needs keying by bridge identity, not just period —
and it still needs this assertion, because the moment something on the trading
path reads these figures, a shared result stops being a latency fix and becomes
stale data behind a decision.
