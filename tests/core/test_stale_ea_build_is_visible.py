"""A stale EA build must be visible on screen, not only in the log.

Reported live 2026-09-09. The owner recompiled the EA and re-attached it, and
the chart still showed the v1.05 behaviour -- Global Harvest reading "profit
per trade" and not summing across positions. `tools/deploy_ea.sh` had not been
run first, so MetaEditor rebuilt the copy already sitting in its own Experts
folder rather than the repo's v1.06.

**The app already knew.** It had logged, on every EA connection since 12:44:

    EA VERSION MISMATCH: terminal is running v1.05 (compiled 2026.09.09
    12:44:17) but this app ships EA source v1.06. The .ex5 is stale --
    run tools/deploy_ea.sh, then compile (F7).

It is a WARNING, so it sat in a log nobody was reading while the fix appeared
not to work. `deploy_ea.sh`'s own header records that this exact failure once
cost a full day: *"a batch of EA fixes was written, reviewed, committed, and
'recompiled' several times, while the terminal kept compiling a source from
three weeks earlier"*. It has now happened twice.

So the state reaches the top-bar EA badge, which is where an operator already
looks to see whether the EA is live. A green badge on a stale build is the
screen saying the opposite of the truth.
