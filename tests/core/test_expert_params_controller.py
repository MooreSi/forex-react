"""The Expert Tunables page reaches the catalogue through a controller (M7).

The settings page must not import the service directly: reads and writes
here hit the database, and every DB call from a NiceGUI callback has to go
through the controller layer's off-loop dispatch or it stalls the event
loop. That boundary is enforced by the frontend-never-imports-the-database
contract, which is one of the two enforced at zero.

These tests drive the controller functions the page calls, so the page
itself can stay a thin renderer over a catalogue it does not interpret.
