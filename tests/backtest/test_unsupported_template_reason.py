"""A refused template must say it was refused, not report a row of zeros.

From the owner's question on 2026-09-04, looking at a Strategy Comparison
table: "why does the top strategy show all 0?"

    30 TP1 SL50 and Trail   0   0   0   0%   +$0.00   ...   Prof Factor inf   $1,000.00
    Asian - Single         90  47  43  52%  +$512.00  ...
    GD VIP - Single        90  68  22  76%  +$121.00  ...

Nothing was wrong with the template or the signals. The run was tick-based,
and `30 TP1 SL50 and Trail` uses trail_mode=candle, which the TICK walk
deliberately refuses -- the EA trails to the last 3 closed M15 candles and the
tick walk has bid/ask, not a candle series. The bar walk supports it. So the
same template is simulated on bars and refused on ticks, and the refusal
arrived as `None` per signal, which aggregated into zeros.

Returning None rather than approximating is right and must not change: "a
plausible number from a template the walk cannot model is worse than no
number, because it would be used to choose what trades real money". But zeros
in a comparison table do not read as "refused". They read as a strategy that
traded nothing and lost nothing -- which, sitting beside a row showing 62.8%
max drawdown, is an argument FOR the refused template. The reason has to
travel with the result.

template_support.summarise already takes this position for the picker: "Every
template gets a row, including the unsupported ones. Omitting them would read
as 'this template does not exist' rather than 'this template cannot be
backtested, and here is why'."
