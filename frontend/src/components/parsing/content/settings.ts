/**
 * Every switch on the Parsing tab, as data.
 *
 * Transcribed from the NiceGUI page by parsing its source. The wording matters:
 * each of these decides whether a Telegram signal is traded, and a description
 * that drifts from what the backend does is how somebody turns the wrong one on.
 *
 * **This list is why the tab has a test that counts rows.** The Parsing tab
 * shipped from the 2026-08-25 upstream merge with its settings section an empty
 * stub and its whole body parked in a function nothing called: every switch
 * disappeared from the UI while staying fully wired in the backend, so
 * `immediate_market_entry` could not be turned on and a bare "Buy Now" signal
 * was missed. Nothing went red, because the render test pinned the auth wizard
 * and not the settings. `ParsingPanel.test.tsx` now asserts every row here
 * reaches the screen.
