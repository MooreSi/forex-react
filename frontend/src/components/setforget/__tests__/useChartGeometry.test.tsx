/**
 * The geometry hook's resilience, as opposed to its arithmetic (which
 * `SetupChart.test.tsx` covers through the component).
 *
 * `ResizeObserver` is the whole file. The hook watches the chart's container
 * so the overlays follow a resize, and constructing one unguarded means that
 * anywhere it is missing — jsdom, an older Safari, a server render — the
 * constructor throws inside a passive effect and React unmounts the entire
 * section. The chart does not degrade; the Set & Forget tab goes blank.
 *
 * This was found as a flaky test rather than as a bug report: the panel's own
 * suite stubbed the global in `beforeEach` and cleared it in `afterEach`, and
 * a passive effect that landed after the clear failed about one run in three.
 * The flake was the symptom; the missing guard was the defect.
