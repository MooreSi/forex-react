/**
 * How the EA template's ~100 fields are laid out on screen.
 *
 * The fields themselves — name, type, default, allowed values — come from the
 * backend (`GET /api/trading/templates/schema`), because a hundred field types
 * maintained in two languages drift the first time one is added to only one of
 * them. What lives here is the part the backend has no opinion about: which
 * fields belong together, in what order, and what to call them in English.
 *
 * **Nothing is unreachable.** A field this file does not mention falls into
 * "Other settings" rather than disappearing — that is the rule that keeps a
 * newly added backend field editable without a matching change here.
