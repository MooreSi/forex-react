/**
 * Every setting on the Risk tab, as data.
 *
 * Transcribed from `frontend/pages/settings/_risk.py` by parsing its source.
 * **Each `key` is a column of `vantage_risk_settings`**, and
 * `tests/api/test_settings_writes_reach_the_store.py` checks that against the
 * schema rather than trusting this comment.
 *
 * That check exists because the first React version of this tab offered four
 * fields, two of which were not columns at all: `risk_pct` (a column on a
 * different table) and `daily_loss_limit_pct` (a column nowhere). Both raised
 * on save, so the operator typed a number, saw it stay in the box, and it was
 * never stored. The real names are `risk_per_trade_pct` and
 * `max_daily_loss_pct`.
 *
 * The wording matters as much as the names. These decide how much a single
 * trade can lose and when the account stops for the day; a paraphrase is how
 * somebody sets the wrong one.
